Importance of Unique Titles,Unique titles and descriptions are crucial for ranking at the highest level in search engine results. The search engine decides which listings to place on top of the search results based on meta titles and meta descriptions.,37
Bulk Editing,The tool allows you to manipulate specific categories of products and give them variables to construct whole titles and descriptions. You don't have to go through each product one by one.,31
Using the Tool,"To use the tool, go to Applications or Apps and search for ""SEO spinner."" Install the spinner, which is built by CloudCart, for SEO optimization. You will see three tabs: Products, Categories, and Brands. They all work the same way. In this example, we'll focus on manipulating product data.",49
Variables and Conditions,"You can add variables and conditions to specify which categories you're working with, and the system will generate titles and descriptions accordingly. Be careful not to duplicate categories from one condition to another.",33
Creating Unique Titles,"To create unique titles, you can mix text and variables. You can also use different patterns for different products. To specify different variations for specific categories, add them within the conditions.",31
Creating Unique Descriptions,"The same process applies to descriptions. You can use variables, text, and variations to create unique descriptions. You can also use curly brackets and semicolons to create variations of keywords, phrases, or sentences.",33
Saving and Generating Combinations,"Once you have created your conditions and patterns, save your condition and click ""Override All Data"" to apply these changes to your products. Then, generate all combinations and wait for the system to process them.",35
Preview and Edit,"You can preview the generated combinations and edit specific titles and descriptions if needed. Once you're satisfied with the results, click ""Finalize"" to apply the changes to all your products.",30
Size Chart Application,"To get the size chart feature, we need to go to applications and search for the size chart application built by CloudCart. This application is a paid application. Once it is installed, the merchants will be able to define the size charts before doing so, prepare the landing pages for the size charts. To create the size chart pages, go to marketing landing pages and build the landing pages.",69
Creating Size Charts,"The title of the size chart is only for internal use to orientate for what the chart is for. The second title is visible for the users, so make sure it is a good and readable title. Select the category, and only the products under that category will show that title. If there is a specific vendor, select that as well. Hit save, and the particular page is created.",69
Product Pages,"To see which products have that page, go to the product page and check. If the size chart is visible, then the page is enabled. If the size chart is not visible, then the page is not enabled. The size chart is only applicable for the products that are under the selected category. If there is no category, unfortunately, it cannot be assigned. The size chart page will only be visible on products under that category or category and vendor.",80
Conclusion,Using the size chart application is way more powerful than the previous functionality. It is simple but a better way to present the products with the exact number of sizes based on the category or category and vendor. The whole concept is to define specific size charts on specific categories or vendors based on specific criteria.,56
Example,"Triggered products can be used to send messages to customers who browse products under a specific category. For example, you can send a message with three or four or eight discounted products from that category or a dynamic discount promo code for a specific product. This will encourage customers to make a purchase and improve their shopping experience.",58
Trigger,"The trigger for a campaign is the segment, which is a set of conditions that a visitor or customer must enter or exit to activate the campaign. The conditions for triggered products should relate to the products in your store. The trigger can be purchases, cart, subscribed products, memberships, product reviews, or wish lists.",54
Campaign,"To create a campaign for triggered products, select the appropriate segment and use the triggered product widget to include products related to the segment. You can then build a contextual email with a dynamic discount code to encourage customers to make a purchase.",43
What are Web Hooks?,"Web hooks are a feature in CloudCart that enable events in the store to be sent outside the store to a third-party application. As soon as an event occurs, such as a new order, the web hook will fire an event and transfer information regarding the order, such as customer details, shipping information, or product information, to the third-party application.",60
Benefits of Web Hooks,"The benefits of web hooks are that they fill the gap between software in the e-commerce store and software for inventory management or other third-party applications. Web hooks provide a missing piece of the puzzle in two-way integrations with third-party applications, which ensures that information related to events such as orders, product updates, or customer registration is sent immediately without waiting even for a second.",65
Setting Up Web Hooks,"Web hooks can be set up under the settings menu in the web hooks section. The first step is to select an API key to give web hooks permission to run and fire events based on the key. The second step is to select the destination URL, where the information related to the events will be sent. There is a service called webhooks.site, which allows testing the destination URL and events for webhooks.",73
Testing Web Hooks,"Web hooks can be tested by editing orders or products and ensuring that the events are immediately fired and transferred to the third-party application. Web hooks can also be tested with services such as webhooks.site, which provide a destination URL for testing.",42
Real-Time Integration Example,"An example of real-time integration using web hooks is a service that provides tickets for public transport. As soon as the order is validated with the paid status, a QR code is generated, and the customer receives it instantly. This is a real-time integration between the store and the third-party application.",51
Conclusion,"CloudCart web hooks are a powerful and professional way to make a two-way real-time event integration between two or more applications. It provides valuable information in real-time, which can be used for inventory management, order management, or other integrations. More information can be found at help.cloudcart.com.",46
Product Statuses,"Go to the ""Products"" page and select ""Product Statuses"". By default, the platform has ""In Stock"" and ""Out of Stock"" statuses. To enable the subscription feature, you can either add an ""Out of Stock"" status and change its behavior or add a new status. We recommend using the default ""Out of Stock"" status and changing the action from ""Select new"" to ""Show as subscribed for quantity"". Change the name of the status to ""Notify me when available"" or any other desired name.",82
Subscribing to an Out of Stock Product,"Once the product status is set up, go to a product that is currently out of stock. The product page will display a ""Notify me when available"" button, which allows users to subscribe to the product.",36
Creating a Segment,"To collect all subscribers for out of stock products, go to ""Marketing Campaigns"" and select ""Segments"". Create a new segment using the ""Subscribed for product availability"" condition. This condition is simple and effective, but you can add additional conditions if desired.",41
Creating a Campaign,"Go to ""Marketing Campaigns"" and select ""Automated Campaigns"". Create a new campaign with a title and enable the ""Repeat this campaign for customers who got into it for more than once"" option. Select the previously created segment. Choose the appropriate action type and channel, such as Viber or web push notifications, and create the message template. The template can include variables, such as the triggered product, which will be based on the specific actions of your store and users. Add any desired additional steps, such as checking if the link was clicked, and specify the goal of the campaign. Once the campaign is started, it will automatically notify users when their subscribed product is back in stock.",117
Mandatory Things to Know,"This setup is irreversible, so you cannot undo your product catalog settings. The system will start a procedure which will split all variant values and create different products based on the variant value that you're going to split. For example, if you split by color, you will have different products based on each color variant. This option is payable.",59
Steps to Split Variants,"Go to the products main menu and then the variants menu. Select the option that will split all products that contain the variant option you want to split (in this case, color). Turn on the setting and name each product with its variant value. When you save, the system will start a procedure to split all products based on their color.",61
Viewing the Split Products,"After the procedure is complete, you will have different products based on each color variant. Each product will contain the name of the color value, and you can showcase all your colors on the listing pages. When a customer selects a color, the color will be automatically selected and reflected in the checkout page as a variant option.",58
Important Details,Product feeds and applications that generate product content like CSB or XML files will be affected by this feature. All product feeds will have to be regenerated. This feature is a great way to showcase all your products in a different way.,42
Functionality,"The Suppliers application allows merchants to have multiple suppliers for different products, each with their own prices and availability. The application allows for easy comparison of delivery prices and identification of the best supplier for a particular product.",38
Setting up Suppliers,"To add suppliers manually, go to the product section and click on the ""Suppliers"" link. Here, you can add as many suppliers as you wish and assign them to specific products. Alternatively, you can use the XML import application to automatically import products and assign them to suppliers.",48
Adding Suppliers to Products,"When adding suppliers manually, go to the product detail page and select the supplier from the dropdown menu. You can also assign a delivery price and an identification number for both your store and the supplier's store.",37
Tracking Inventory,"CloudCart can track product inventory at the supplier's store, and merchants can disable a specific supplier for a product if they are out of stock.",25
Order Products,Merchants can use the Order Products feature to filter by supplier and make bulk orders for all products under a specific supplier.,22
Benefits,"The Suppliers application allows for easy comparison of delivery prices, determination of the best supplier for a product, and automation of product catalog and pricing for different merchants.",28
Product Inventory Section,"The product inventory section allows you to manage your product inventory. You can use the filter option to search for a product by SKU, barcode, or product description. You can also filter products by category and quantity. Additionally, you can save filters and use them as tabs for quick searches and filter options.",53
Importance of Managing Inventory,"It is essential to manage your inventory to have a clear visibility of what's inside the warehouse, what's in stock in the online store, and what is out of stock in the product catalog. CloudCart focuses on delivering functionality that is really important when you are not working with warehouse software.",51
Product Listing Page,"The product listing page represents your product inventory. The difference between the inventory and the product section is that we split the product variants into products because each line here represents a product and its variations. For example, a product can have several variations between size and color, which we represent in a list of each product variation and each combination of that variation.",64
Managing Quantities,"To manage quantities, you can add or set a quantity for each product variation. Adding a quantity increases the number of products in stock, while setting a quantity replaces the existing quantity with the new number. You can also decrease or increase the quantity by a specific number.",48
Filters and Criteria,"You can use filters and criteria to manage your inventory. For example, you can select specific SKUs or filter products that are out of stock. This is helpful when you want to enable continuous selling for products that are out of stock because you know they will be restocked soon.",50
Using Categories,"Categories help you manage your inventory by organizing products by vendors, manufacturers, subcategories, etc. You can easily manage categories by adding new ones and subcategories, which makes it easier to find specific products.",33
Adding a Category,"To add a category, go to the side panel and provide data such as the name and description of the category. The URL address is generated automatically but can be edited. The system will check for duplicate names. A handy feature is the automatic 301 redirects if you change the URL slug when editing a record.",56
Category Description,You can add a description to your category using the text editor. You can also make the category a child of a parent category or add an image to the category.,31
Google Taxonomy,"Google taxonomy is a required field to define categories in product feeds. It will be used as the name of the category, no matter what name you choose for it. You can choose the taxonomy definition from a search bar.",40
Subcategories,You can add subcategories to a category in two ways: by adding a category and choosing the parent category or by dragging and dropping an existing category to the parent category. You can also merge two categories to make them parent and child.,43
Displaying Subcategories,"You can display subcategories in your storefront by enabling the function on your new category listing. If a category has no products, it will not appear on the storefront.",29
Category Properties,"You can access category properties from the category view. If you see warnings, it means the categories were not defined by the taxonomy, and you should define them to generate product feeds.",32
Improving SEO,Adding text and images to your categories is a great way to improve your SEO and get ahead of your competitors. Relevant keywords in the category description also help in search results.,32
Understanding Brands and Vendors,"Vendors and brands are filters that are useful for navigation through the products. Brands refer to the company or manufacturer of the product. In CloudCart, it is easy to upload the brand logo, brand description, and meta title and description.",40
Vendor Page,"Each brand has its own page, where all the products that are into that brand are listed. Once a brand has been created, you can click on the brand and you will be redirected to the page of the vendor.",40
Benefits of Having a Vendor Page,"Vendor pages are useful in increasing the visibility of the website into the search results of Google. For example, if someone searches for a particular brand, your website will be ranked higher in the search results due to the presence of the vendor page.",44
Brand Page,"The brand page is the place where you can read the text about the brand, some sort of information about the brand, and the logo.",25
Mandatory Brand for Products,"It is not mandatory to choose a brand for a product, and products can be displayed without anything under them.",20
Defining Smart Collections,"Smart collections are a way to combine different products based on specific criteria into a single page, without the need to manually select each individual product. This feature can save time and effort, especially when dealing with a large number of products.",42
Creating a Smart Collection,"To create a smart collection, start by giving it a title that represents the criteria you want to apply. You can also add SEO descriptions and titles from the same page. Next, select the criteria you want to use, such as specific products, categories, discounts, brands, or taxes. You can also use operators such as ""not in"" to exclude products from certain categories.",63
Tagging Products,"You can also use tagging to create a smart collection. For example, you can tag products that are meant to be included in a specific collection with a unique tag, and then create a smart collection that includes all products with that tag. This is particularly useful when dealing with large numbers of products.",54
Using Smart Collections,"Smart collections can be used in various ways, such as creating discounts, showcasing products, generating feeds for selected parties, and more. They can also be used to build landing pages that feature a specific collection of products. When used smartly, smart collections can save time and effort and provide a seamless shopping experience for your customers.",56
Conclusion,"Smart collections are a powerful feature unique to CloudCart that allows you to combine different products based on specific criteria into a single page. By understanding the functionality of smart collections, you can use them to save time and effort and provide a better shopping experience for your customers.",49
Getting Started with Product Bundles,"To use product bundles, you need to install the Product Bundles application from the All Applications menu in your store's Ups menu. Once installed, you can find it in the Products menu under Bundles. Initially, you won't have any bundles, but you can start creating them from here.",48
Bundle Setup,"Setting up a bundle is a manual process, and you need to tell the system how to combine the products and how to present them. From the Advanced Settings menu, you can set the bundle's title, upload an image, and write a description. You can also choose which products to include in the bundle and set the bundle's price.",59
Bundle Configuration,"Once you've selected your products and set the bundle price, you can configure how the bundle appears on your storefront. You can change the page title and description for the bundle, set validation dates, and even show a timer to encourage customers to buy before the bundle expires. You can also choose how the bundle appears on your storefront, such as a list of products or a product listing in the landing page.",73
Advanced Settings,"In the Advanced Settings menu, you can make further customizations to the bundle. For example, you can change the quantity of a product in the bundle or change the order of the products. You can also check CloudCart's Health Center for more information on bundle functionalities.",46
Conclusion,"Product bundles are a great way to increase your store's average order value, and CloudCart offers a variety of options for setting them up and customizing their appearance. If you have any questions or want to practice your knowledge, you can always reach out to CloudCart's support team.",48
Introduction,"how to add properties to your products in order to make them more searchable, filterable, and organized. Properties are features that can describe a product in a convenient way, allowing users to filter and search based on specific criteria.",39
Category Properties,"Category properties are features assigned to specific categories and can be reused for different products. CloudCart offers three methods to import category properties into your store: manual entry, XML import, and CloudCart APIs. Manual entry is the slowest method, while XML import and CloudCart APIs are much faster.",48
Adding Category Properties,"To add category properties manually, go to the products main page and select category properties. You can add a new property here, give it a name, type, and assign it to specific categories. You can also assign values for that property. Once you're ready, save the property and it will be recorded in the system. You can add as many category properties as you wish.",65
Merging Values,"CloudCart offers a feature called merging values that allows you to merge more than two values into one value, especially helpful when working with large sets of data. To merge values, select the values to be merged, and CloudCart will combine them into a single value. You can also assign an image to each property value, making it easier for users to search and filter your products.",67
Assigning Category Properties to Products,"Once you have created your category properties, you can assign them to specific products. Go to the product's page and select the product you want to assign properties to. Click the ""Category Specific Properties"" button and enter the property values. Once you're ready, submit the properties and publish the changes. You can then filter and search for products based on their properties.",62
Adding Category Properties Manually,"To add category properties manually, go to the ""Category Properties"" tab in your CloudCart store, click ""Add Property,"" and fill in the necessary details. Once you have added the property, you can add values to it by clicking on it.",40
Using Category Properties as Filters,"Once you have added your category properties and values to your products, you can use them as filters by going to ""Category Properties"" and selecting which properties to activate as filters.",31
Showing Specific Category Properties,"To show specific category properties on a product page, go to ""Widgets > Products"" in your store and select ""Show category properties here"" and ""Show category properties with images in sidebar."" Then, select an image for each value.",38
Choosing Category Properties,"After selecting a category, you can choose category properties. These are attributes of the category, and their values are attributes of a product. Category properties are predefined in the Category Properties menu.",32
Purpose of Category Properties,"Category properties display the main characteristics of a product. They cannot be changed or chosen by the customer, as they are constant facts about the product. These properties can be used for filtering products in the catalog and providing more information about the product. However, they cannot be chosen when purchasing a product. Consider the example of buying a TV. Attributes such as screen size, technology (LCD, OLED), and resolution (4K, 8K) are category properties. These specifications are fixed and cannot be chosen by the customer. They help users filter through the product catalog and narrow down their search to find the desired product.",104
Creating Category Properties,"To choose a category property, it must be created beforehand. To do this, navigate to the Category Property menu, create a new property (e.g., resolution), and specify its values. Once created, you can assign these properties and their values to products.",41
Multiple Values for a Property,"It is possible to select more than one value for a single property, although specific use cases may vary. This feature allows for flexibility in representing product attributes.",28
Methods of getting information out,"There are three major methods of getting information out of the store. The first one is by downloading a CSV file, which is a basic method for downloading orders, invoices or customers, but it cannot handle a large amount of product catalog data. The second method is through XML files, which is the most popular way of getting information out of the store. The third method is using the CloudCart API, which allows merchants to extract data programmatically by making requests.",81
Purpose of getting information out,"The purpose of getting information out of the store is to synchronize product catalogs with third-party applications, supply partners with relevant information regarding stock levels or pricing, and provide resellers with valuable information. XML feeds are useful for feeding Facebook or Google or any other third-party application with the product catalog of the store to make advertisements based on the behaviors of their merchants. There are a lot of possibilities and scenarios regarding why XML feeds are so important for the merchants.",82
CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator,"The CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator is a powerful tool for generating different product feeds with different types of information. To start, a merchant needs to create a new XML feed by giving it a name. The merchant can then filter down the products based on specific criteria, such as by category, brand, smart collection, or tax. Password protection is also available to secure information getting out from the hands of partners.",72
Configuring CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator,"The CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator has options for tracking purposes, such as for tracking the actions of customers that came from a partner website. The settings for turning off and on are for product quantities, product discount price, append hidden products, and append out of stock products. Once the merchant is happy with the settings, they can hit save, and a job is created to produce the XML file. The generation of the XML feed is incremental by 12 hours, and the content will be different if there are differences.",91
Purchasing Additional Products,"To purchase additional products, users can click on the ""Purchase"" button, which will redirect them to the pricing lists. From there, they can select the quantity of products they want for their XML files. It's important to note that any limitation applied to purchasing products will apply to all feeds, not just specific ones. So, if a user has five product feeds, all 45 product feeds will have a limitation on the number of products.",75
Product Feed Overview,"Once the product feed is ready, users can view it and see information such as the product name, address, category, and pricing. The price displayed may be discounted, as users can set up discounts for specific merchants. There will be no reference to quantities, only the stock availability. The XML feed generator is a powerful tool for dealing with product catalogs and sharing information with partners or resellers.",68
Unique XML Feed Generator,"CloudCart's XML feed generator is a unique feature that is not commonly found in the e-commerce world. Many services offer this feature as an additional service or application. However, CloudCart's XML feed generator is included out of the box and seamlessly integrates with users' stores.",45
Facebook Product Catalog,CloudCart's Facebook Dynamic Ads application creates a product XML feed used for building a product catalog directly into Facebook Business Manager. The purpose of creating the XML feed is to create and manage remarketing campaigns on Facebook. Merchants can read more about how to set up the product feed on CloudCart's Health Center.,53
Google Merchant Feed,Google Merchant Feed is used to drive Google Ads marketing campaigns with products. Merchants can use the product merchant feed to drive remarketing ads and display ads that are for getting brand new audiences. Merchants can read more about how to set up the product feed on CloudCart's Health Center.,50
Bulgarian Revenue Agency,"CloudCart has a specific application for the Bulgarian Revenue Agency, which generates an XML feed file based on the specification of the NRA. Merchants can use this application to supply the NRA with specific information regarding their orders.",38
Criteo,Criteo is one of the major players in the ad world and provides merchants with tools for driving their marketing campaigns through retail. Merchants can create Facebook and Google marketing ads and need a product feed for that purpose. The product feed is created based on Criteo's criteria and specifications. The product feed updates every 12 hours automatically.,58

Scroutz.gr,Scroutz.gr is a Greek application used for price comparison. Merchants can copy and paste the product feed into Scroutz.gr's application profile.,21
Features,"The Google Sheets integration offers a lot of features for manipulating product information such as titles, descriptions, pricing, discounts, categories, vendors, product creation, images, and meta information. This powerful application enables you to manipulate the database across the entire store from one simple table.",44
Installation,"Once you pay and install the application, you will be forwarded to a page where you have to grant access to CloudCart to your specific Google Drive where your files will be stored. You will then work with your Google Spreadsheet.",41
Discount Option,"The Google Sheets integration has a discount option that automatically imports discounts on every single product. You simply need to select the discount you have already created. Products that are imported or updated from Google Sheets with the ""discount price"" field will create discounts in the store.",47
Filter Options,"There are three filter options in the integration. ""All products"" means all products will be imported into Google Sheets. ""Filter by category"" allows you to select a specific category to work with and the products only from that category or categories will be uploaded. ""Filter by products"" means that you can select specific products to upload into Google Sheets.",59
Selecting Columns,"You can specify which columns of the products you want to upload to Google Sheets. If you don't select any, the entire product catalog with all the columns will be uploaded. This is done because Google Sheets has a limitation of five million cells per document, which can be easily exceeded with a large product catalog.",56
Opening Google Sheets,"Once you click the button to open your spreadsheet, you will be redirected to the product table at Google Sheets. The table will have headings for columns such as product ID and product name, and under that, you will see all the products with their IDs and names.",48
Manipulating Data,"You can use formulas to manipulate the data and change product titles, quantities, pricing, and more. You can even have pictures and import products from Google Sheets. If you leave the ""Product ID"" field blank, a new product will be created for you with a brand new ID. However, be careful when working with Google Sheets, as you can easily mess up your entire store and product catalog.",68
Exporting Data,"You must spend as little time as possible between uploading and downloading the product catalog to avoid any discrepancies caused by new orders or other changes. It is also recommended to remove quantities if you are not going to work with them to avoid any issues. If you change the name of the columns, you can run into problems, so it's best to avoid changing them.",66
Restrictions,"One minor restriction is that you can only add simple products, not multiple variations. You can also only add products to a fixed discount or a simple discount. The integration allows you to use structure with special symbols to show that a category is a subcategory, but there is no reference to the categories themselves.",55
Pricing,"To sell a product, you need to set its price. In CloudCart's user interface, you will find several fields that are mandatory for dealing with products, one of which is the price. SKUs are another important field, as they are used for synchronization with other applications for product updates, such as pricing and quantities. SKUs can be identified using barcodes, product IDs, or other means.",65
Product Variation,"Product variation refers to the different versions of a product that are available, such as different colors or sizes. In CloudCart, variations are set up in a table format, with one row per product variation. In this way, merchants can have many variations of one product model, such as a sweater, in different colors and sizes. We will now explain how to set up product variations in CloudCart's user interface.",70
Product Variation Setup,"To set up product variations in CloudCart, you can use a radio button, drop-down menu, image sample, or color sample. Radio buttons are best for fewer variations, while drop-down menus are better for more. Image samples are best for presenting different product colors, and color samples are best for presenting different product sizes. You can choose the type of variation you want to use in the ""Variant Type"" dropdown menu. You can also add images, SKUs, barcodes, quantities, and pricing for each variation in the table.",86
Product Variation Presentation,"Product variations are presented differently depending on the variation type you choose. For example, radio buttons are best for presenting fewer variations, while drop-down menus are better for presenting more. Image samples are best for presenting different product colors, and color samples are best for presenting different product sizes. You can also use a banner or small image to present variations in a more artistic way, depending on the product. Keep in mind that the presentation of product variations should be easy to understand for the customer.",87
Creating Variations,"To create a product variant, you can combine different options together. For example, if you have two options for size and two options for color, the system will combine each size with each color to create a matrix of product variations. You can select up to three product variations and up to 150 values per variation.",56
Using Quick Filters,"Quick filters can be used to easily select all options for a product. To use this feature, select the options you want and then enter a price for all.",29
Limitations,CloudCart has limitations on the number of product variations you can create. You can have up to three product variations with up to 150 values per variation.,27
Presentation Styles,"CloudCart offers different presentation styles for product variations, including radio buttons, color swatches, and table views. The speaker recommends using the most commonly used presentation style, which is a combination of color and size options.",35
Numerical Options,"CloudCart also offers numerical options for products, which can be useful for representing size and other numerical values. These options are presented in two dimensions, with the first representing the numeric value and the second representing the alpha value.",39
Using Category Properties,"If you have a product with only one value for an option, it is recommended to present this as a category property rather than a product variant. Category properties can also be presented with images in the sidebar.",38
Translations,"If you want to change the name of a feature, you can do so by going to the Translations section in the settings and searching for the feature name.",29
Adding Product Options,"To add a new product option, go to the product options menu and click ""Add New."" You will see two fields for the name: one for internal use to orientate in the product options menu and the other will be visible in the storefront. Add a label for the product option and choose if it's required or not. Choose the option type (image, text field, checkbox, etc.) and set a price if necessary. In the ""Connection"" field, choose the product or category to apply this option to, and then save the changes.",92
Testing Product Options,"After adding the product options, go to the product page in the storefront to see how they appear. Make sure to test the options by selecting different choices and checking if the price changes accordingly. Ensure that required options prompt a warning if they are not filled out before adding the product to the cart.",55
Rearranging Product Options,"If needed, rearrange the order of the product options by going to the product options menu and dragging and dropping the options to the desired order. You can also rearrange the values and roles that you added on a specific product option.",42
Introduction to Product Options,"In this guide, we will present the ability to add product options in CloudCart. Product options are additional features or choices that can be added to a product details page. They can modify the price of a product or remain free. However, product options do not have SKUs, and their quantity is not tracked.",54
Example Scenario,"For instance, you might be selling gifts for kids and want to offer customers the option to add a gift wrap, a happy birthday card, or customize the product with a name. These options are not mandatory, but they can bring added value to the product and potentially increase the order value.",52
Adding a Product Option,"To add a product option, go to the product options menu, and click on ""Add New Product Option"". Fill in the name for internal use and the name for the storefront. Choose if the option is required, the option type (such as image, text, or checkbox), and if there's an additional value associated with the option. Finally, select the product or category to which the option will be applied, and save.",71
Example: Custom Image and Text,"In this example, we will add two product options to a keychain that can have a custom photo and text. The first option will allow customers to upload an image, and the second option will let them input custom text. Both options will be required and free.",47
Example: Gift Wrap Option,"The third product option will be a paid option for gift wrapping. This option will not be required, and customers can choose from different wrapping options with associated prices. This option can be added as an image selection with single selection enabled.",42
Testing and Adjusting Options,"After setting up the product options, test them in the storefront to ensure they work as expected. Make any necessary adjustments,",21
Application Stores: Local Pickup,"The local pickup application offers three main features: enabling a shipping method for local pickup, allowing local payment, and providing the ability to add quantity per product for each store. This is especially useful for merchants with multiple warehouse locations or physical stores in different cities or locations within a city.",51
Store Quantities and Geolocation,"By knowing the quantities for each location and their physical addresses, you can define locations at your online store and assign them to your physical locations. This allows customers to see only the products that are in stock for a specific store that offers delivery to their address, making it convenient for customers and helping merchants manage their inventory more efficiently.",61
Setting Up Stores and Quantities,"To begin, you'll need to add your stores within the application. Once your stores are added, you can then add the quantities of your products per store. You can do this in two ways: through XML synchronization or via CloudCart's API. Both methods allow you to easily import and synchronize your product quantities per store.",55
Shipping and Payment Options,"You can set up local pickup as a shipping method and select the stores that accept local pickup. Additionally, you can choose which payment provider will be used for local pickup, allowing customers to pay at the store if desired.",40
Local Pickup and Geolocation in Action,"By combining local pickup, product quantities per store, geolocation, and customized shipping and payment options, you can create a seamless experience for your customers, whether they prefer to shop online or in person. This is particularly beneficial for brick-and-mortar merchants and those in the grocery industry.",46
Identifying the Product Catalog Source,"The first step in managing your product catalog is to identify the source of your products. There are several concepts to consider, such as manually importing or uploading products, which has already been covered in previous videos. This guide focuses on managing your product catalog with external sources, where some automation and centralization are needed. You need to understand the entire chain of getting products from an external source and importing them into CloudCart.",74
Understanding the Structure of Data,"Next, you need to understand the structure of the information you are going to receive and import into the online store. This information should include product name or title, description, categories, information about the vendor or manufacturer, pricing, inventory levels, and any other relevant field options. This understanding will help you create a comprehensive and efficient process for importing product data into your online store.",65
Identifying Data Sources,"You must also identify how many data sources there are for your product catalog. Understanding whether there is a single source or multiple channels from which you will receive information about your products is crucial. If you are working with multiple data sources for a single product catalog, you need to decide which is the main source and how to handle the rest. This will help you to aggregate information from different sources and import it into your store effectively.",80
Managing Prices from Different Sources,"When dealing with different prices from different suppliers, you must decide which supplier offers the best price and whether you want to override the prices from different suppliers or vendors. This will ensure that you can sell your products at the best possible price while keeping track of inventory levels and supplier information.",53
Importing and Exporting Data,"CloudCart is a software with inputs and outputs, meaning that you can import and export data related to products, categories, or any other relational structures. This can be done on an event-driven basis or at specific times. It is important to note that importing orders is not currently possible in CloudCart due to the complexity and relationships involved in order data. However, understanding how to import and export data effectively is essential for managing your product catalog and ensuring that your online store operates smoothly.",85
Data Entry Methods,"There are several methods for importing data into CloudCart. For customers, you can use CSV imports or API. For products, there are many more ways, including using external data sources and automating the process. Understanding these different data entry methods will help you choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs and ensure that your product catalog is managed effectively.",61
CSV (Comma Separated Values),"CSV is a simple and basic data format, which is essentially a spreadsheet or table type of data saved by comma-separated values. This format is popular for transferring information and is commonly used with old-fashioned software like warehousing or ERP systems. CSV is suitable for one-time imports due to its basic structure, but it's essential to have unique identifiers for each product record to avoid issues with synchronizing data.",69
XML (eXtensible Markup Language),"XML is a more structured data format that uses tags and data, making it easier for software to read and import products. It is a standard and non-standard format, allowing flexibility in how data is organized. XML is ideal for continuous syncing of data and requires unique identifiers for each product record. We have a dedicated help article detailing the structure and import process into CloudCart.",66
API (Application Programming Interface),"CloudCart's API provides a more advanced way to communicate with the store and manipulate data. It enables programmers outside CloudCart to access and manage product data, categories, customers, orders, and more. The API is well-documented and available for paid plans only. Using the API allows greater flexibility and control over importing and syncing products.",54
Google Sheets,"Google Sheets is another method for importing products, offering a user-friendly spreadsheet interface for uploading and downloading products, manipulating data, and managing quantities and prices. CloudCart has a comprehensive help article related to Google Sheets, and the application is suitable for basic users.",43
Unique Identifiers,"It is crucial to define unique identifiers for each product record when importing and syncing data. These identifiers can be SKU, barcode, or external ID, but never the product name. Unique identifiers allow software to find, update, or import products accurately. Without them, you may end up with duplicate or incorrect product data.",53
European System Integrations and Dropshipping Models,"CloudCart supports more than ten European ERP integrations, offering built-in synchronization and import options for merchants using specific ERP systems. Dropshipping models, like Brands Distribution, allow merchants to import and sell products without storing them. XML files can also be used for dropshipping. Some integrations and models are specific to certain vendors and may vary in functionality.",57
CSV to XML Conversion,"CloudCart offers a service to convert CSV files to XML format, allowing merchants to import and sync data using the more structured XML format. This process involves taking the CSV file, converting it to XML, and then importing it back into CloudCart using applications like XML Import or XML Sink. This service can help standardize data output for merchants and automate processes.",62
Introduction to Selling Digital Products,"In the digital era, merchants are seeking solutions to sell their products, coaching materials, and online courses. CloudCart's infrastructure and platform accommodate different digital online stores and retailers.",28
Types of Digital Products,"There are two types of digital products: 1) Files, such as music, videos, eBooks, or any downloadable content; and 2) Resources, which provide membership access or restricted area access for customers who have paid for the content.",37
Store Setup for Digital Products,"When setting up an online store for digital products, consider if it will be oriented solely towards digital products or a mixture of digital and physical products. For example, a retailer selling computers may also sell digital licenses.",38
Cart and Checkout Settings,"Pay attention to cart and checkout settings. If your store focuses on digital products, disable the ""require shipping address on registration"" option. Turn off guest checkout and set your store for members only to grant customers access for later usage. Decide if you require a billing address for issuing invoices or not. Remember that requesting a billing address may slow down the purchasing process.",64
Adding Digital Products,"To add a digital product, follow the same steps as adding a physical product, but select ""Digital"" under product configuration. Choose the type of digital product (file or resource), and upload the file, if applicable. You cannot require shipping for digital products, but you can track inventory. However, you cannot have variations for digital products.",55
Checkout Process for Digital Products,"When checking out with digital products, the shipping address step is skipped, and customers are directed to the payment method selection. After completing the order, customers can download the product files or access the restricted content.",36
Security of Digital Files,CloudCart provides a secure environment for storing digital files. The platform encrypts the information about the product and stores it in hidden folders that are not directly accessible from the outside. Merchants can be assured that their digital files are protected from unauthorized downloads.,44
Upselling and Cross-selling with Digital Products,CloudCart also supports upselling and cross-selling options for digital products. Leverage these features to increase sales by offering additional products or services related to the customer's initial purchase. Watch the video tutorial on upselling and cross-selling for more information.,39
Accessing Purchased Digital Products,"Once a customer has purchased a digital product, they can access the content from their account. The customer can log in to their account and navigate to their ""Files"" section to download the purchased file or access the restricted content. Customers can access their purchased digital products at any time, making the process convenient and user-friendly.",56
Best Practices for Selling Digital Products,"When selling digital products, consider the following best practices: 1) Ensure your store setup is optimized for selling digital products, including appropriate cart and checkout settings; 2) Clearly describe the digital product and its features to help customers understand what they are purchasing; 3) Offer upselling and cross-selling opportunities to increase sales; 4) Maintain a secure environment for digital files, ensuring customer trust in your store.",66
Managing Digital Product Inventory and Promotions,"Although tracking inventory for digital products is not always necessary, using the inventory tracking feature can help create a sense of urgency for promotional purposes. For example, you can set a limited number of digital copies available during a promotion, encouraging customers to make a purchase quickly. Keep in mind that you cannot have variations for digital products, so plan your promotions accordingly.",63
Restricted Content Access for Members,"When selling digital products that grant access to restricted content, make sure that only customers who have purchased the content can access it. CloudCart's platform ensures that restricted content is only accessible to customers who have paid for it, providing a seamless experience for both merchants and customers.",48
Customer Download Access,"Once the digital product file and order are complete, customers can download the file directly from their account. They will also receive information about the order, including access to an invoice (if invoicing is enabled) and information about the order status.",41
Disabling Email Templates,"If you prefer not to send certain information to customers, you can go to Marketing > Omnichannel > Email Templates and turn off specific email templates. This way, customers will only receive information relevant to downloading the files.",38
Membership Access and Paid Content,"CloudCart offers membership access for paid content, ideal for online coaches, courses, and presentations. This content can be set up with limited or unlimited access, depending on your preference. To get started, go to Applications and search for the Membership App, which is a paid application. Install the app to enable the selling of digital content online.",57
Creating a Digital Product with Membership Access,"After installing the Membership App, return to the Products section and select a specific product to be digital. This time, the digital product type will be 'Page.' Before proceeding, prepare your pages by going to Marketing > Landing Pages. Create a new page and mark it as 'Private,' so it is accessible only for specific users. The private pages will be available for selection under the product options.",68
Setting Access Duration,"When setting up the digital product, specify the number of days the pages will be accessible for customers after a successful purchase. For example, if you set it to 15 days, customers will have access to the content for that duration.",41
Membership App Email Template,"Upon installing the Membership App, a new email template named ""Send Access to Pages"" will be added. This template informs customers when access to restricted content is granted and includes a link to the specific pages. Be sure to review and customize this email template as needed.",47
Purchasing and Accessing Paid Content,"When a customer purchases a product with restricted access, they will receive an email with access information and links to the pages. Customers can also access the paid content directly from their account by clicking on ""Paid Content."" This option is available as long as their access is active.",49
Subscription Management,"With the Membership App installed, a new menu option named ""Subscriptions"" will be available under the Orders menu. Here, you can view and manage subscriptions for specific customers, including information about the subscription's duration and accessibility, and the pages included in the subscription.",43
Product Listing Page,"The Product Listing Page serves as your central hub for viewing and managing your entire product catalog. From this page, you have access to various tools and features that allow you to efficiently manage your inventory, such as filtering options, search functionality, and bulk actions. Additionally, you can view essential information for each product, such as SKU, price, and stock levels.",61
Advanced Filtering and Searching,"CloudCart offers a range of advanced filtering options that enable you to refine your product list based on multiple criteria. You can apply filters for categories, brands, price range, stock status, and more. Additionally, CloudCart's search functionality allows you to find products quickly by keyword, SKU, product name, description, or barcode. The platform also supports searching for products with specific attributes or custom fields, ensuring that you can locate and manage any item within your inventory with ease.",78
Bulk Actions and Tools,"The Bulk Actions feature in CloudCart allows you to perform actions on multiple products simultaneously, streamlining your product management process. To access this feature, navigate to the Tools menu, which becomes available once you have selected specific products or all products on a page. From here, you can apply various actions to the selected items, such as updating prices, adjusting stock levels, modifying product visibility, and more. You can also create custom bulk actions using CloudCart's API for even greater control over your inventory management.",85
Introduction to Product Statuses,Product statuses in CloudCart are used to manage the availability of products on your online store. There are two default product statuses: In Stock and Out of Stock. These statuses help merchants manage their product inventory and display the availability of products to customers accordingly.,45
Setting Up Default Product Statuses,"To set up default product statuses for your store, create two major statuses: In Stock and Out of Stock. The In Stock status should show the ""Buy"" button for products with a quantity greater than zero, while the Out of Stock status should hide the ""Buy"" button for products with a quantity of zero or less. You can also enable the ""Continue Selling"" option to allow customers to place orders even if the quantity is zero.",76
Adding Custom Product Statuses,"You can add custom product statuses, such as ""Pre-Order,"" to your store. Make sure they don't overlap with your default product statuses. When creating a new custom status, you can leave conditions unspecified, or you can select conditions that don't overlap with other product statuses. Once you've added custom product statuses, you need to map the default In Stock and Out of Stock statuses in the system. This ensures that the platform uses the default statuses for all products, except those that you manually assign a custom status.",88
Manually Assigning Product Statuses,"You can manually assign specific product statuses to individual products. To do this, navigate to the product edit page and select the desired In Stock and Out of Stock statuses for that product. Manually added product statuses have higher priority in the system and will be displayed on the product page. For example, you can assign a ""Pre-Order"" status to a product that doesn't have a quantity yet but will be available at a later stage.",76
Using Actions for Product Management,"Actions in CloudCart provide useful tools for managing your products. These actions include duplicating a product, previewing a product, embedding a product on an external website, and generating a checkout link for a product. To duplicate a product, click the ""Duplicate"" action. To preview a product, click the ""Preview"" action. To embed a product on an external website, select the ""Embed"" action, choose a template, customize the appearance, and generate the code to be embedded. To generate a checkout link, click the ""Checkout Link"" action and copy the link. You can then share this link with customers through chat, email, or messenger applications.",103
Using Checkout Links,"When you share a checkout link with a customer, it adds the specified product to their cart and directs them to the checkout page. If the customer already has items in their cart, the checkout link will add the new product to their existing cart without starting over. Keep in mind that the generated checkout link will only add one quantity of the product to the customer's cart, so they may need to adjust the quantity to meet any minimum order requirements you've set.",84
Additional Actions for Products,"In addition to setting up product statuses and adjusting quantities, CloudCart offers several other actions to help manage your products. These actions include duplicating a product, previewing the product page, embedding a product on an external website, and generating a checkout link for direct purchase. Duplicating a product creates a copy of the original product, excluding its images. Previewing the product page allows you to see how the product will appear on your website. Embedding a product on an external website involves generating a code that can be copied and pasted into another site, where the product and its add-to-cart functionality will be displayed. The checkout link feature generates a direct link to add the product to a customer's cart, which can be shared via chat, email, or other messaging applications. This allows for a quicker purchasing process, as customers can directly add the product to their cart and proceed to checkout.",152
Utilizing the Short Number Field,"The short number field allows you to assign a specific position to a product in the product listing. By entering a numerical value in this field, you can dictate the order in which products appear when customers browse through a product category containing multiple items. This feature enables you to strategically place products, enhancing visibility and potentially driving sales.",59
Adjusting Sort Settings,"To ensure your product listing adheres to the specified short number order, you must modify the sort settings within the store. This step is crucial, as it allows the platform to recognize and display the products according to their assigned positions.",41
Hidden Products and Visibility,"If a product is not visible in the product category page, it may be marked as hidden. Hidden products will not appear in the listing, so to make them visible, you must change the product's visibility settings.",37
Short Number Field: Zero Considerations,"When using the short number field, it's important to understand that the value '0' is treated differently. The platform interprets '0' as a larger number than any other value entered, so avoid using it as a sorting order. Instead, utilize numbers ranging from 1 to 2,000 or more, ensuring your products are displayed in the desired order.",57
Adding a New Product,"To add a new product to your CloudCart store, navigate to the product management interface, and click on the ""Add New Product"" button. This will open a form where you can enter all the necessary information about the product, such as its name, price, and inventory status.",47
Brand and Vendor Selection,"For each product, you can specify the brand and vendor. This information will allow customers to filter the catalog by the manufacturer or maker of a product. You can either select a vendor from a pre-existing list or create a new vendor by typing in their name.",47
Tags,"You can add tags to your products and choose from pre-defined tags or create new ones. Tags can be used to create relationships between products, such as pairing socks with shoes. This feature can be used to display related products at the bottom of a product detail page, based on similar tags. Tags can also be used for upselling by displaying products that complement each other, such as a TV stand for a 32-inch television.",75
Product Dimensions and Shipping Information,"When entering product details, you can input the dimensions of the product. These dimensions are used for calculating shipping costs with courier services and will not be displayed on the storefront. It is important to note that these dimensions are for shipping purposes only and should not be expected to appear on the product page for customers to view or filter.",61
SEO Configuration,"In the product editor, you can configure the SEO title and description for each product. These settings help improve the visibility of your products on search engines. If you enter a description for your product, an SEO meta description will be generated automatically. You can edit this information to create a more tailored and optimized description for search engines. It is crucial to have an SEO-optimized product page to ensure better visibility on search engines and increase the chances of attracting potential customers.",83
Image and Multimedia Manager,"CloudCart's multimedia manager allows you to upload images, 360-degree images, and videos directly from YouTube to showcase your products. The platform will automatically compress and optimize images for fast loading and better performance. You can add up to 36 images for a 360-degree view of a product, creating an interactive experience for customers. You can also drag and drop images from your local storage for easy uploading. The multimedia manager supports managing multiple images, deleting them, and even setting a YouTube video as the main media for a product.",89
Publishing a Product,"Once you have entered all the necessary product information, you can publish the product online. You have the option to schedule the product's publication for a later date or set an expiration date for the product to be automatically unpublished. After publishing the product, you can use the shortcut provided in the product editor to view the product detail page on your storefront.",63
Short Description Field,"In the product editor, you can add a short description for each product by clicking the ""Short Description"" button. This field is not mandatory but can be used to provide a brief overview of the product or highlight specific features. This field supports HTML code, allowing you to add images, icons, or other visual elements to enhance the product presentation. It is important to create a visually appealing and informative product page to engage customers and encourage them to make a purchase.",82
360-Degree Images,"Adding 360-degree images to a product can provide a more immersive and interactive experience for customers, giving them the impression of viewing a 3D model of the product. To create a 360-degree image, users can upload up to 36 different perspective images. In the storefront, customers can manipulate and rotate the final image for a smoother viewing experience.",58
Introduction to Product Configuration,"When configuring a product in CloudCart, it's essential to understand the various settings and attributes involved. These settings help manage inventory, track sales, and provide customers with accurate information about the products they're purchasing.",34
Choosing Product Type,"First, determine if the product you're configuring is a physical or digital product. Physical products require shipping and handling, while digital products involve uploading a file that customers will receive upon purchase. Physical products are more commonly sold on CloudCart, but digital products offer an easy alternative for certain sellers.",50
Configuring Shipping Settings,"For physical products, enable the Require Shipping setting. This allows you to input the product's weight, which is crucial for calculating shipping costs with courier services. Accurate weight information helps customers understand the total cost of their purchase, including shipping fees.",41
Inventory Management,"Enable the Track Inventory setting to monitor the quantity of products you have in stock. When inputting quantities that include decimals, remember to use a point (.) instead of a comma (,) to avoid confusion. This setting ensures that your inventory numbers are accurate and up-to-date.",46
Continuous Selling Option,Enable the Continuous Selling setting if your product can be restocked or produced on-demand. This setting allows customers to continue purchasing the product even when the inventory reaches zero. It's especially helpful for sellers who create their own products or can easily restock items.,44
Low Stock Notifications,"To receive notifications when a product's inventory is running low, set a Low Quantity Threshold. When the product's quantity reaches the specified number, you'll receive a notification alerting you that the product is almost out of stock. This helps you stay informed about your inventory levels and plan for restocking.",50
Minimum Purchase Quantity,"Set a Minimum Quantity if you want to require customers to purchase a certain amount of a product. Customers can add smaller quantities to their cart, but they won't be able to complete the checkout process until they meet the minimum quantity requirement. This feature helps increase average order value and may be useful for bulk sales or promotional offers.",60
Product Identifiers: SKU and Barcode,"Choose an identifier for your product, either an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) or a barcode. SKUs are typically used for tracking inventory with warehouse software, while barcodes are often provided by the product's manufacturer. Both identifiers help manage inventory and track product sales.",43
Understanding Product Statuses,"Product statuses help you manage inventory and sales by providing vital information about product availability. Familiarize yourself with these statuses to ensure that your product listings are accurate and up-to-date, ultimately improving the customer experience on your CloudCart store.",39
Basic Features,"Today, I'm going to review with you several basic features integrated into the Multilingual application. You can expect functionalities such as creating a brand new language version which actually creates a brand new store, copying the design, copying the navigation, copying pages created with the page builder, copying blog posts and categories, and copying the entire product catalog.",58
Advanced AI Translation,"On top of these features, our merchants will be able to translate every single bit of text from the main store to the target language of the language version with advanced AI technology, thanks to our partners from Google. The translation quality is really good, especially for basic information such as colors or short descriptions.",55
Store Settings and Translations,"Make sure that your content is equal to your store settings in order to expect great results. We charge our merchants per processed character. If the character is not translatable, it doesn't mean that it is not processed. Every single character that is processed will be charged.",47
Accessing the Multilingual App,You can find the application from the App Store. Install the Multilingual App and follow the configuration steps to create a new language version.,24
Creating a New Language Version,"From the app, add a language version related to your main business. This language version will copy the information from the main store. Select your desired target language and follow the steps to complete the configuration.",36
Copying and Translating Elements,"In the app, enable copying and translation for various elements such as design, menu, blocks, and pages. Note that design cannot be translated and pages built with the page builder will not be translated.",34
Translating Product Catalog,"Select which elements of the product catalog you want to be translated, such as product names, descriptions, categories, and image alternative texts.",22
Adjusting Prices for Language Version,"When copying prices from the main store to the language version store, you have the option to multiply the prices by a specific factor or set the decimals to a specific value for marketing purposes.",35
Choosing a Subscription Plan,"Choosing a subscription plan from here gives our merchants an additional discount on the pricing because they are creating an additional subscription for a language version. This is a huge benefit, as they get an additional discount for creating their additional language version.",43
CloudCart Synchronizer,"We highly recommend using CloudCart Synchronizer, which is a huge advantage. This application synchronizes product quantities from the main store to the language version store. If merchants prefer two-way communication for the synchronization of quantities, they must purchase CloudCart Synchronizer additionally for the language version store to push data to the main store.",53
Confirmation Page and Tracking Progress,"On the confirmation page, you can see your plan, copying information, and fees for copying and AI translation. Once you pay, you will be redirected to the tracking progress page, where you can see the progress of the application. The translation process depends on the volume of characters and sentences that need to be translated. If there are millions of characters, the translation process could take hours.",67
Storefront Language Settings,"The flags displayed on your store represent the storefront language. No matter what the language version of the channel is, the flags are a representation of the storefront language. When you click on a flag, you will be redirected to the general settings of the corresponding language store.",48
Additional Settings,"In the additional settings, you can find options for copying newly added products from your main store to the language version, translating them, and copying pricing information. You can also set the price rounding and choose an approval method for the newly added products (manual or automatic). There is also an option for automatic deletion of products deleted from the main store, which helps keep your product catalogs tidy across different languages. Pay attention that additional services must be purchased for these settings to work. If you don't have enough funds or tokens for these services, you won't be able to take advantage of these options.",106
Language Switcher,"Enabling the language switcher option will display a switcher on your store's homepage, allowing customers to switch between different languages. The switcher can be configured from the additional settings.",29
CloudCart's Marketing Focus,"CloudCart is one of the most advanced e-commerce platforms on the market, enabling our customers to use marketing tools to drive more traffic and engage with more customers. Our company's core philosophy is to help our merchants drive more sales, get more traffic, and convert more users into customers. Because of this, we focus our efforts on building more marketing tools.",61
Marketing Tools Available,"At CloudCart, you can find more marketing tools than any other marketing platform that is e-commerce oriented, and vice versa. In other words, we have tons of features for marketing. We offer more than 10 types of discounts with over 100 options to create different discounts at scale without needing to do it manually. Our platform includes up-sales, cross-sales, down-sales, landing pages, sales funnels, and campaigns that enable you to contact your customers at scale through an automated process. Additionally, we have trigger-based emails with contextual content that will be delivered to every single customer who takes any action at your store. We also offer bundles and many other marketing tools to help you succeed.",115
Importance of SEO,"Search engine optimization is vital for our customers because most websites receive 60-70% of their traffic through search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Baidu, etc. By using CloudCart's search engine friendly tools and features, you can achieve more organic search traffic, also known as ""free traffic.""",47
Controlling Robots,"One of the primary purposes of SEO is to control the robots (like Googlebot) that crawl your website. There are two main aspects to this: controlling the robots and managing the content on your website. With CloudCart, you can easily manage the robots through the robots.txt file and the sitemap.xml file.",51
Robots.txt,The robots.txt file lives on each website and tells robots which pages they can visit and which they cannot. This file is essential for SEO because it helps prevent search engines from indexing low-quality or irrelevant pages on your website. CloudCart has a built-in robots.txt file that you can control through the marketing settings of the platform.,57
Sitemap.xml,"The sitemap.xml file works alongside the robots.txt file to show search engines which pages they should visit. By creating a sitemap.xml file, you can ensure that search engines only index the most important pages on your website, such as product pages, categories, and contact pages. CloudCart has a built-in sitemap.xml file that you can control through the marketing settings of the platform.",62
Canonical Tag,"The canonical tag is another essential tool for controlling the robots and avoiding duplicate content on your website. This tag tells search engines that a specific page is a copy or child page of another, more important page. This helps to prevent search engines from indexing multiple versions of the same page, which can lead to lower rankings. CloudCart has built-in canonical tags for product and category pages.",68
Using CloudCart's SEO Tools Responsibly,"It's important to note that CloudCart's SEO tools are powerful and should be used with caution. If you are not familiar with SEO best practices, it's a good idea to consult with a professional before making any significant changes to your website's settings. Misusing these tools can lead to your website being penalized or even banned by search engines.",59
Conclusion,"In conclusion, CloudCart offers a range of built-in SEO tools that can help you optimize your e-commerce website for search engines, leading to increased organic search traffic and improved visibility for your products and categories. By controlling the robots and managing the content on your website, you can ensure that your site ranks highly in search engine results, attracting more potential customers and ultimately driving more sales.",67
Understanding Filters and Dynamically Generated Pages,"Filters and dynamically generated pages often generate a lot of URLs that need to be crawled by search engine crawlers. To avoid being spammy to Google, it's crucial to restrict crawlers from accessing all of these pages. One way to do this is by adding ""no index, no follow"" tags to the HTML pages. This will prevent the pages from being indexed or crawled by search engine robots.",68
Controlling Indexing of Filtered and Sorted Pages,"To control the indexing of filtered and sorted pages, navigate to Marketing > Main SEO > Index Filtered and Sort Pages. Here, you can specify the number of parameters you want to be indexed by search engine crawlers. The default settings are optimized for best results, but you can play around with the numbers if you know what you're doing. Remember, changing these settings without proper knowledge can negatively impact your website's search engine ranking.",75
301 Redirects and Controlling Robots,"The 301 redirect feature is essential when you want to delete a product or change a URL without losing search engine ranking. A 301 redirect tells search engine crawlers that the old URL has permanently moved to a new address. To set up a 301 redirect, go to the SEO section and click on ""Add Redirect."" You can choose a specific product or manually input the new URL. This feature is also helpful when migrating customers from old systems to CloudCart by importing redirects from a file.",87
Importance of 301 Redirects,"Using 301 redirects correctly can significantly impact your website's search engine ranking. They help maintain your ""crawler budget"" and ensure that search engine crawlers access the most relevant pages on your website. By implementing 301 redirects, you can seamlessly migrate customers from old systems to CloudCart without losing search engine ranking and maintaining the effectiveness of any existing online advertisements.",60
Croll Budget and Dessert Pages,"To help Google avoid spending too much time on unnecessary pages, we provide them with only the best content, referred to as the ""dessert"" pages. This is achieved by using various tools enabled by default in CloudCart.",37
Server Side Rendering,"Server side rendering is a complex, top-notch functionality found on CloudCart. It provides better visibility for search engines and a stable infrastructure to crawl without disturbing the user experience. Each CloudCart store has a separate environment for crawlers and humans, ensuring that customers can browse the website with ease, while crawlers can access the server-rendered copy of the website. This technique saves merchants time, energy, and server power, leading to a better browsing experience for real users.",77
Structured Data and Rich Snippets,"CloudCart utilizes structured data, also known as rich snippets, to make the website content more understandable to bots. This technology allows the presentation of information like product names, descriptions, URLs, brand names, offers, and more in a bot-readable format. CloudCart uses JSON-LD, which is Google's preferred format for structured data. This helps enhance search engine results with additional information like pricing and stock status.",64

Most businesses are required to display prices inclusive of VAT for end customers. Ensure that product prices are set accordingly, and the tax module is configured to include or exclude VAT as required.",61
Adding VAT for a Specific Country,"To add VAT for a specific country, first, delete any existing tax settings and then click on the ""Add Tax"" button. Input the tax rate (e.g., 20% for Bulgaria) and select whether the product prices include tax or not. Configure the tax settings based on the customer's location and business type (B2B or B2C).",54
Tax Calculation and Shipping Costs,"Determine when the tax will be applied - before or after shipping costs. If the merchant charges customers for shipping costs, taxes should be calculated after the shipping cost. If customers pay the shipping cost directly to the delivery provider, taxes should be calculated before the shipping cost.",48
EU VAT Regulations,"When selling within the European Union (EU), CloudCart has integrated all EU countries, simplifying the tax configuration process. When selling goods in your home country, apply the local VAT rate to all customers. When selling goods to another EU country, apply VAT only to end customers, as businesses pay VAT in their home country. The tax module is built to handle these scenarios automatically, ensuring compliance with EU VAT regulations.",70
Texts for VAT Application,"The texts for VAT application are left empty as they differ for different countries within the EU and for customers outside the EU. The VAT rates can be different depending on the country, region, or product category.",37
Different Taxes for Different Categories,"Some countries have different tax rates for different product categories. For example, bread might have a 0% VAT, while children's goods may have a lower VAT rate than the standard rate. This allows merchants to apply different VAT rates for specific product categories.",43
VAT Overrides by Category and Region,"CloudCart allows you to create VAT overrides based on product category and region. For example, you can set a lower VAT rate for children's goods in a specific region or city. This way, only customers in that particular location will receive the discounted VAT rate.",45
VAT Application in Multiple Countries,"If you operate in multiple countries, the platform will determine the customer's location and apply the appropriate VAT rate accordingly. This includes different rules for applying VAT to customers and companies, as well as applying VAT before or after shipping costs.",41
VAT Overrides by Region,"If you want to apply different VAT rates to specific regions without defining a product category, you can do so using VAT overrides by region. This allows you to apply different tax rates for customers in certain locations.",38
VAT for Companies and End Customers,"VAT rules may differ for companies and end customers. For example, a Bulgarian company might charge VAT to end customers but not to other companies. CloudCart ensures that VAT is applied accurately and keeps the platform compliant with relevant authorities.",40
Adding VAT Numbers,"If a company adds their VAT number and it is validated by the platform, the VAT will be removed from their order. If the VAT number is not present or not validated, the system will not remove the VAT. This ensures accuracy and compliance with regulations.",46
Fees,"Fees work similarly to taxes, but they can be added as a percentage or a flat fee. Fees can be added for various reasons, such as packaging, delivery, or handling. To add fees, go to taxes and then add fees.",40
Benefits of CloudCart Features,"In the past, online store owners had to manage all the necessary information regarding shipping their packages by hand. But today, CloudCart offers many integrated features, such as real-time shipping cost estimations and real-time payment.",35
Pre-built Shipping Methods,"Every CloudCart store comes with pre-built shipping methods based on price, weight, and a combination of price and weight. Shipping methods can also be assigned to specific regions, payment providers, and product categories.",33
Carrier Integrations Overview,"CloudCart is constantly working on integrating different shipping providers. Currently, there are around seven or eight fully integrated shipping providers. These integrations include real-time shipping cost estimation, waybill generation, email notifications, and more.",33
DHL Integration,"To integrate DHL, go to applications and search for DHL. Enter your credentials and customize the provider's name, logo, and other settings. The integration supports various service types and allows you to create waybills, send tracking information, and more.",39
Other Carrier Integrations,"CloudCart also integrates with various country-specific carriers such as Speedy, Econt, Fan Courier, Cargus, ACS, and DPD. These integrations offer similar features to the DHL integration. Check the help center for more information about each integration.",36
Order Fulfillment and Email Templates,"When fulfilling orders, you can generate waybills and send tracking information to customers using email templates. The templates include order status updates, delivery dates, and tracking codes.",27
Creating and Managing Waybills,"When working with orders, you can fulfill products with the click of a button, which will provide a live shipping cost estimation. You can change various details and generate waybills, which can be printed directly from the store.",38
Quick Order Explanation,The quick order option is not an actual order but rather a way for customers to express their interest in a specific product. This feature only works for individual products and cannot be used to purchase multiple products at once.,40
Enabling Quick Order,"To enable the quick order feature, go to Apps > All Apps and search for the card icon with a timer. Install the application to your store, and you will see additional configuration options.",34
Advanced Features,"The quick order app uses innovative technology to gather information from a customer's IP address. This can help determine their country and possibly their city without asking for that information. You can also require a phone number, first and last name, and email address from the customer.",47
Tracking and Events,"You can define your own personal events for the quick order, such as when a customer clicks the button but doesn't finalize the order. You can also track separate events for regular checkout and quick order options.",37
Text and Styling,"Customize the text that appears on the fast order page and after the customer clicks the ""Purchase"" or ""Make Order"" button. You can also play with styling options and colors for the quick order button.",35
Order Submission,"When a customer submits a quick order, they will need to provide their email address, phone number, and accept terms and marketing policies. This information goes directly to the merchant's administrative area.",32
Order Processing,"In the Orders menu, a quick order is indicated by a small couch or chronometer icon. Quick orders don't have complete addresses, so you will need to contact the customer for their address before preparing the order for shipment.",39
Fulfilling Quick Orders,"After obtaining and validating the customer's address, you can select a shipping provider and fulfill the product. Information can then be sent to the customer for tracking purposes.",28
Payment Options,"Quick orders primarily work for offline payments like cash on delivery or bank wire transfers. For online payments, you will need to send the customer a link to finalize the order.",31
Disadvantages,"Quick orders can increase merchants' workload since they must manually handle shipping and billing addresses, payment preferences, and more. While it allows merchants to accept requests faster, it also increases manual work.",32
The Checkout Process,We invested significant time in providing a seamless checkout experience that includes monitoring and analyzing thousands of orders and customer behavior to create a comprehensive solution for the checkout and cart settings. We constantly add new features and functionalities to make the process more adaptable and flexible for customers.,49
Abandoned Cart Reminder,"The abandoned cart reminder is an advanced feature that is a competitive advantage for CloudCart. It reminds customers about items in their checkout process but not completed as an order. Enabling this feature will send transactional emails to remind customers about their abandoned carts. You can choose which type of reminder to send (email, messenger, or both). The timing of the reminder is crucial and can be set between 30 and 180 minutes.",73
Shipping Address for Digital Products,"In rare cases, you may want to ask for a shipping address for digital products to be covered by seller protection. This can help prevent disputes, refund requests, and chargebacks, as you'll have evidence of delivering the order.",38
Automatically Select Shipping Option,"If there is only one shipping option, this setting will automatically select it, reducing the number of steps in the checkout process.",22
Minimum Order Amount,"Setting a minimum order amount can help increase your average order value (AOV). Calculate your current AOV and increase it by 15% to determine the minimum order value. Keep in mind that this setting should have a relation between the pricing of your product catalog. The minimum order amount is an intrusive way to increase AOV, so ensure it is not set too high.",64
Maximum Product Quantity,"This feature allows you to set a maximum count of one product that can be added to the cart. For example, you can limit your customers to purchase no more than three pieces of a specific product.",37
Maximum Cart Quantity per Customer,"This feature sets a maximum number of products in general, not per product, that can be added to the cart. For example, if you set a limit of one product, customers will not be allowed to purchase more than one product. This feature may not be popular because it restricts sales, but can be useful when you have a limited number of products or want to implement specific marketing strategies.",70
Email Notifications for Low Product Quantities,"This setting allows you to receive email notifications when the total quantity of a product decreases to a certain threshold. By enabling this feature, there is no need to set up individual product thresholds for sending notification emails.",38
Order Status and Product Quantity Decrease,"It is crucial to understand how setting up the right configuration for order status (pending, paid, or fulfilled) will impact product quantity decrease and other processes like sending email notifications to customers for order processing. Your choice of payment methods (online or offline) can also affect how product quantities are decreased based on order status. Make sure to stick with your current settings and avoid changing them if you have open orders.",72
Default Shipping Type,"You can choose a default shipping type (e.g., pick up from store or shipping address) that will be automatically selected and opened for your customers during the checkout process. This can help guide customers and make the process smoother.",39
Default Shipping Provider,"If you have multiple shipping providers, you can select a default shipping provider that will be automatically selected during the checkout process. This can also help make the process faster and smoother for your customers.",35
Default Payment Provider,"You can choose a default payment provider that will be automatically selected during the checkout process, making it faster and smoother for your customers.",24
Unique Order Number,"Instead of using a system ID, it is advisable to use a string of numbers and letters as a unique order number. This can prevent competitors from tracking your progress and order numbers, and it also ensures a unique identifier for each order without any gaps.",46
Payment Microservice Architecture,"We built payments as a microservice, which means there is a separate payment gateway, a different database, different codes, and different servers that accept requests from third-party providers like payment providers. This independency allows us to scale the platform and guarantee our merchants a 100% working process and environment. Thanks to this microservice architecture, we can accept currently more than 1,500 transactions per minute.",64
CloudCart's Transaction Volume,"To date, CloudCart processes around 45-100 transactions per minute. In the past year, we have processed more than three million transactions, which represent around €250 million in transactions.",28
Payment Provider Integration Framework,"We have developed an innovative framework that enables our developers to integrate new payment solutions in no more than 24-48 hours. If you have a customer that is interested in integrating CloudCart with a payment solution that is not yet presented, the cost of the integration will be split between CloudCart and the customer, with each party covering 50% of the estimated cost.",63
Current Payment Providers,"To see the payment providers currently integrated into CloudCart, go to Settings and Payments. Some major providers include PayPal, Braintree, Mollie, Stripe, Paymypols, Keepa Touch, Feed Bank, Borica, Paysafe, Raiffeisen Bank, Connectix, MobilePay, EveryPay, and SeePay. We also offer cash on delivery, pay at store, vouchers, and bank wire options.",50
Invoicing Basics,"Invoicing in CloudCart allows you to set up and automate invoicing for your e-commerce store. Invoices are sent to customers automatically via email as attachments. Additionally, the invoicing module also includes credit notes, which are useful when refunding money to customers who return goods.",44
Invoice Formats,"Invoices in CloudCart can be output in two formats: PDF and CSV (comma-separated values). The PDF format is sent to customers via email, while the CSV format can be downloaded from the invoicing section of the orders menu. The PDF format is used to send invoice documents to customers, while the CSV format is useful for sending order and payment information to your accounting team.",65
Invoice Settings,"To access the invoicing settings, go to the settings menu and find the invoicing option. From there, you can activate the invoicing feature, set up invoice issuing conditions, and configure the invoice number padding, prefix, and suffix. Customize your invoice numbers to meet the requirements of your government or tax authority.",51
Business Credentials and Credit Notes,"In the invoicing settings, you can also enter your business credentials, such as your business name, VAT registration number, and contact information. For credit notes, set up the invoice number padding and select the payment method used for refunds. It's important to stick with the actual payment method used for making the order and payment.",55
Customizing Invoices and Packing Slips,"CloudCart allows you to add a watermark text to your invoices and customize the design of your invoices, packing slips, and credit notes using provided variables. Download the template, make your desired changes, and paste the modified code back into the platform. This allows you to create a unique brand identity for your invoices and packing slips. If you wish to revert to the default template, simply delete the custom code.",71
Invoicing Automation,"The invoicing module in CloudCart automates the invoicing process for each order, saving you time in managing orders and invoices. Invoices are sent to customers via email, and you can easily download the CSV file with invoices to send to your accountant. This automation is essential for any e-commerce business.",50
Geo Zones and Google Maps,"Geo zones in CloudCart are based on Google Maps technology. Although it is possible to use geo zones without Google Maps, integrating Google Maps into your store will provide a more comprehensive feature set. To integrate Google Maps, follow the instructions in our help center article. Without Google Maps integration, geo zones will only provide country-level detail.",57
Creating a Geo Zone,"To create a geo zone, first determine your store's needs and the area it serves. Geo zones are based on customer geo coordinates. Add a new geo zone and name it accordingly. Once created, you can configure the zone with different operators, such as ""includes"" or ""includes only,"" to specify which countries, cities, or neighborhoods are included in the zone. This will help prepare your store to interact with customers from the specified locations.",74
Understanding Operators,"When configuring a geo zone, it is important to understand the difference between ""includes"" and ""includes only"" operators. ""Includes"" means that the zone includes everything from the selected area, while ""includes only"" means that the zone works exclusively for the specific record defined. There are also other operators like ""includes all locations except"" which allows you to exclude specific locations from the geo zone.",64
Configuring Geo Zones,"After setting up your geo zones, you can configure them to include or exclude specific countries, cities, or neighborhoods. For example, if you want to create a geo zone for the European Union, you would need to add each EU country individually. Once your geo zones are configured, they will help determine pricing, discounts, and shipping costs for customers based on their location.",63
Using Geo Zones for Taxes and Shipping,"Geo zones can be used to apply different taxes and shipping rates to customers based on their location. For example, you can create a tax rate that is only applicable to customers in Bulgaria or a shipping rate that only applies to customers within the European Union. This allows you to customize your store's pricing and shipping options based on the specific needs and regulations of the regions your store serves.",71
Setting up Special Discounts,"To create a special discount, navigate to the ""Discount"" section. Only discounts applied at checkout can have customer region restrictions. By defining a GEO zone, you can specify which customers from certain regions are eligible for the discount.",38
Checkout Discounts,"At checkout, you can offer various types of discounts, such as promo codes, countdown discount timers, and container discounts. These can be tailored to specific GEO zones, meaning that only customers from certain regions will be eligible for the discount. To create a discount for a specific GEO zone, select the region from the available options.",56
Localization and Working Hours,"By using GEO zones, you can estimate delivery times for specific regions and customers. For example, you can integrate with applications like Working Hours to provide accurate delivery estimates based on customer location. If you need more information on this, refer to the help center.",45
GEO Zones and Platform Adaptation,"When you use GEO zones, your platform will adapt to the customer's address, adjusting pricing, discounts, and shipping costs accordingly. This allows you to create a personalized shopping experience for different groups of customers based on their location.",38
Creating and Managing GEO Zones,"You can create an unlimited number of GEO zones and define unlimited local entities for each GEO zone. However, it's important to note that sometimes Google Maps data may not be complete or consistent due to various factors, such as local authorities not providing sufficient data. To address this issue, you can use the geo polygon feature.",57
Geo Polygon Feature,"The geo polygon feature allows you to define specific blocks on Google Maps by inputting coordinates. This can be particularly useful if you want to focus on a specific street or region. To create a geo polygon, search for your desired location, click on the map to draw the polygon, and then assign a name for easy identification. You can then assign the geo polygon to a GEO zone in the ""GEO Zones"" section. This feature provides total control over your store's localization, allowing you to cater to specific areas or even individual houses, as well as the entire world.",100
Shipping Methods and Geo Zones,"By assigning a geo polygon to a GEO zone, you can restrict shipping methods to specific locations. For example, a shipping method could be visible only for addresses within the defined geo polygon. This level of control extends to discounts, pricing, and shipping costs, enabling you to create a highly personalized shopping experience based on customer location.",57
Applying Discounts Based on GEO Zones,"To apply special discounts based on customer location, you can create discounts that are only applicable at checkout. These discounts will have the ability to define the customer region and can be applied to specific GEO zones, such as specific countries or regions. Examples of checkout discounts include promo codes and countdown discount timers.",54
Creating a Discount for a Specific GEO Zone,"To create a discount for a specific GEO zone, start by defining the zone in the admin panel. For example, you can create a discount that is applicable only for customers in Bulgaria or the EU. This allows you to offer different discounts to customers based on their location.",49
Estimating Delivery Time Based on GEO Zones,"You can estimate delivery time for specific regions and customers using the ""working hours"" functionality in CloudCart. This feature is useful for calculating delivery times based on the customer's location. If you do not have this functionality enabled, you can find more information in the help center.",47
How GEO Zones Work at Checkout,"When a customer goes to checkout, the platform adapts the pricing, discounts, and shipping costs based on their location. For example, if a customer from Bulgaria is eligible for a discount and shipping method specific to their GEO zone, these options will be displayed at checkout. If the customer's address changes to a different country, the discount and shipping options may be removed or updated accordingly.",66
Creating and Using Geo Polygons,"Geo polygons allow you to define specific areas on Google Maps by inputting coordinates. This feature is useful when the data from Google Maps is incomplete or inconsistent. By creating a geo polygon, you can specify a particular street or area where you want to offer discounts, shipping options, or different pricing. To use a geo polygon, simply draw the area on the map, assign it to a GEO zone, and apply it to the relevant features such as discounts, shipping, or pricing.",83
Mixing and Matching GEO Zones and Geo Polygons,"You can mix and match GEO zones and geo polygons in your store's settings. For example, you can include a specific country and a geo polygon within that country, or you can use a geo polygon exclusively. This allows for greater customization of your store's features and offerings based on customer location.",52
Controlling Localization with Google Maps Integration,"Integrating with Google Maps, Google Places, geo polygons, and geo zones gives you complete control over your store's localization. You can work with specific areas or houses, or you can work with the entire world, offering various discounts, shipping options, and pricing based on customer location. This level of control is a key advantage of CloudCart's localization features.",58
Summary,"Geo zones and geo polygons in CloudCart allow you to define specific settings for your store based on customer location. By integrating Google Maps and creating tailored geo zones, you can offer customized pricing, tax rates, and shipping options for customers in different regions. This guide has provided an overview of how to create and configure geo zones, as well as how to apply them to various aspects of your store. Use this knowledge to enhance your store's localization features.",80
The Power of the Checkout Process,The checkout process in CloudCart is powerful and fast due to the integration of various geolocation services. We will reveal some features under the hood that make the checkout process efficient and user-friendly.,33
Geolocation Service Integrations,"CloudCart integrates with several geolocation services such as Google Maps, MaxMind IP geolocation database, GeoNames organization, and Google Places. This integration allows the platform to accurately locate customers and populate their information into the data fields.",36
Improved Conversion Rates,"The integration of geolocation services, such as Google Maps, has increased the conversion rate on average by 0.7%. This is a significant increase as it requires minimal effort from the customer during the checkout process.",35
Automatic Field Population,CloudCart's geolocation functionality allows customers to populate their address fields automatically based on their location with a single click. This streamlines the checkout process and makes it faster and more efficient.,31
Address Detection and Validation,The platform can detect and validate addresses and businesses by name. This information is automatically pulled from Google Maps and entered into the appropriate fields during the checkout process.,29
Phone Number Validation and Formatting,"CloudCart's system validates phone numbers and automatically reformats them into a consistent format. This is important for maintaining consistent data structures for campaigns, customer communication, and third-party application integration.",29
Shipping Cost Calculation and Validation,The geolocation information allows CloudCart to provide precise shipping cost calculations and address validation. This eliminates the need to verify addresses manually and ensures that the information is accurate and reliable.,31
Discounts and Product Availability Based on Geolocation,"Based on geolocation information, merchants can offer discounts and display different product availabilities to customers from specific countries or regions. This allows for a more personalized shopping experience for users.",30
Geolocation Redirect Functionality,CloudCart's geolocation redirect functionality enables merchants to redirect customers to specific stores based on their location. This is useful for merchants operating in different countries with separate store domains.,29
Conclusion,"In summary, CloudCart's geolocation functionality provides merchants with improved conversion rates, streamlined checkout processes, personalized promotions and discounts, and better data consistency. This innovative technology combines various services to deliver powerful features for merchants.",34
Verifying Customer Accounts,"CloudCart checkout offers two options for verifying customer accounts: don't verify email addresses and verify email addresses. We generally don't advise merchants to verify their customers' emails, but in some cases, this functionality might be necessary. If the ""verify email addresses"" setting is enabled, users won't be able to complete the checkout until they verify their email address. However, this can make the checkout process less smooth, so use this feature only if it's crucial for your business.",78
Configuring Customer Profiles,"CloudCart allows you to configure the type of customer profiles you accept at your store. By default, it is set to guests and members, but you can change it to members only if needed. Requiring members only is a good option for selling digital products, as guest checkout is not allowed in this case. Based on the product type at the checkout, the platform will decide which type of profile to ask from the customer. For digital products or a mixture of digital and physical products, the platform will require customers to register at the store. If only physical products are in the cart, the platform will allow customers to check out as a guest. It's generally recommended to stick with the default setting (guests and members) unless your business is focused on digital inventory.",135
Guests and Members Functionality,"When the setting is configured to guests and members, the checkout process will be faster for customers with only physical products in their cart, as they only need to add their shipping address. If the customer has a digital product or a mixture of digital and physical products in their cart, the checkout process will require them to register. This functionality creates a consistent and adaptable checkout process based on the products in the cart.",75
Guests Only Functionality,"When the setting is configured to guests only, customers can only check out as a guest, and the login option is removed. However, it is not recommended to set up guest-only checkout, as it may give the impression that the customer is not planning to make future purchases from the store. Instead, it's better to use the default setting of guests and members, allowing customers the option to register or check out as a guest.",75
Converting Guests into Members,"We have a brilliant functionality that converts your guest users into members. When a new customer places an order and provides their name, email address, and phone number, the system automatically creates an account for them using their email as the username and generating a random password. The customer receives a welcome email with their new account information. The next time they visit the store, they can log in using their email and password, which enables a faster and smoother checkout process.",82
Importance of Informing Customers,"If customers are unaware that an account has been created for them, they may get confused and think the platform isn't working properly. To avoid this, it's a good idea to inform customers about their new account on the thank you page or create a custom thank you page with the information.",52
Benefits of Converting Guests into Members,"Converting guests into members allows customers to check out faster by reusing their stored information, such as addresses, from previous orders. This minimizes the steps and fields required during the checkout process, making it easier and more efficient for customers.",40
Hiding Prices for Guests,"There is an option to hide product prices for guest users, which is useful for B2B businesses that want to protect their pricing from casual viewers. When this option is enabled, only logged-in users can see the product prices.",39
Requiring Shipping and Billing Addresses on Registration,"For B2B businesses, it's possible to require customers to provide their shipping and billing addresses during the registration process. This ensures that all necessary information is collected upfront and can be used for order processing and account management.",38
Customization Options,"The platform offers a variety of settings and options for configuring customer accounts and checkout processes to align with your specific business needs. This includes the ability to enable or disable guest checkout, require address information on registration, and more. Continuously explore and customize these settings to optimize your customer experience.",51
Creating an Order: Steps,"To create an order: 1. Click on the ""Create an Order"" button. 2. Select an existing customer or create a new one. 3. Choose the delivery method (based on your store's settings). 4. Input the shipping address from the customer's assigned addresses. 5. Select a product and add the desired quantity. 6. Override the price if necessary. 7. Choose a payment method (offline or online). 8. Select a shipping carrier. 9. Click ""Create Order"" or ""Create Order and Send Email to the Customer.""",83
Offline vs. Online Payment Methods,"There are two main payment method options: offline and online. Offline payment methods include cash on delivery, pay in store, or bank wire transfer. These methods allow you to finalize the entire order without customer intervention. Online payment methods, such as credit/debit card or mobile wallet, require the customer to finalize the order. The customer must confirm the order, select a shipping method, and pay using their chosen online payment method.",71
Creating an Order with Online Payment,"To create an order with an online payment method: 1. Select an online payment provider, such as Braintree, during the order creation process. 2. Click ""Create Order and Send Email to the Customer."" 3. The customer will receive an email with a link to view and confirm the order. 4. The customer must accept the store's policies before confirming the order. 5. Once the customer confirms the order and completes the payment, the order status will change to ""Paid.""",79
Customizing the Order Confirmation Email,"To edit the order confirmation email template, navigate to ""Marketing"" > ""Omnichannel"" > ""Email Templates"" and scroll down to the ""Order Confirmation Email Template."" Customize the template to suit your store's needs.",32
GDPR Compliance,"When creating an order through the admin panel, it is important to ensure GDPR compliance. The best way to achieve this is by sending a link to the customer for them to finalize the order at the checkout process. This allows the customer to accept your store's policies, such as terms and conditions, privacy policy, and GDPR policies.",58
Accessing the Settings,"To access and modify the settings, follow these steps: 1. Log in to your CloudCart account. 2. Navigate to the ""Settings"" menu located on the left side of the dashboard. 3. Click on ""Cart and Checkout"" to open the relevant settings page. 4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you will find options to configure the actions that occur after a customer clicks the ""Buy Now"" or ""Add to Cart"" button. By combining these options, you can create different scenarios and actions in the storefront to optimize the customer experience.",93
Forward to Checkout Page,"The ""Forward to Checkout Page"" option, when selected, immediately redirects the user to the checkout page after they click the ""Add to Cart"" or ""Buy Now"" button. This option streamlines the checkout process and reduces distractions for customers who prefer a quick and direct purchasing experience. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page.",60
Forward to Cart Page,"The ""Forward to Cart Page"" option, when selected and enabled, displays a side panel with the cart contents after the user clicks the ""Add to Cart"" or ""Buy Now"" button. This side panel allows the user to view and edit their cart without leaving the product page, maintaining engagement with the store's offerings. This option is particularly useful for stores that wish to keep customers on the product page while also providing easy access to the cart. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page and ensure the ""Enable side panel"" checkbox is selected.",100
Show Confirmation Pop-up,"The ""Show Confirmation Pop-up"" option, when selected, presents a pop-up window confirming that a product has been successfully added to the cart. This older method of displaying cart updates can also be utilized to upsell or cross-sell products by featuring additional items in the pop-up window. The confirmation pop-up can be displayed when adding products from both individual product pages and listing pages. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page.",77
Do Nothing,"The ""Do Nothing"" option is an excellent choice for grocery stores or B2B businesses that want to enable customers to add products to their carts quickly without any distractions or additional steps. When this option is selected, a small widget appears next to the ""Add to Cart"" button, allowing users to increase or decrease the product quantity directly on the product page. This streamlined option minimizes distractions during the shopping experience, making it ideal for stores that prioritize efficiency. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page.",93
Side Panel (Default Option),"The default option for CloudCart stores is the side panel, which appears when a user adds a product to their cart. This panel allows customers to view and edit their cart contents while remaining on the product page, striking a balance between engagement and convenience. The side panel provides customers with the option to proceed to the checkout, close the panel, or view their cart by clicking the corresponding buttons. By default, this option is pre-selected in the settings page, but can be changed by selecting a different option.",89
How Shared Carts Work,"If you go to the cart, you can see that the link is your cart's unique link. You can copy this link and open it through a brand new browser or send it to your friends or customers through email or chat applications. When someone clicks on that link, the products in the cart of the previous user will be transferred, and a brand new cart with the same items will be created for that particular user. This allows sharing the cart content between devices without affecting the original cart.",90
Merging Carts,"Another feature related to cart management is the ability to merge carts. If you are not logged in and have items in your cart from a previous session, when you log in on a new device, the system will identify your cart items and offer you the option to merge your existing and current cart items. This is useful for finalizing orders that you may have forgotten or combining items from different carts.",73
Merging Carts Demonstration,"To demonstrate how cart merging works, we will use two different browsers to simulate two separate devices. In the first browser, we have an account with five products in the cart. In the second browser, we clear out the cart and add new products that were not in the original cart. Then, we log in to the same account, and as soon as we do, all items from the original cart are transferred and merged with the items from the current session. This means that all products from the original cart have been transferred to the new device, and you don't need to search for them again when switching devices. The same cart with merged items can be viewed on different devices, making it a convenient feature.",127
Cart Merging and Sharing Settings,"To enable cart merging, go to Settings > Cart and Checkout Settings and toggle on the ""Merge Carts"" option. The cart sharing feature is built-in, so you don't have to do anything to enable it.",35
Adding an existing domain,"Go to your CloudCart admin panel, navigate to Settings > Domains, and click on Add Existing Domain. Enter your custom domain (e.g., bigrelease.com) and submit.",25
Choose DNS management option,"You will be presented with two options: Fully Managed DNS Records (recommended) or Managing your domain as a CNAME record. For this scenario, choose the Fully Managed DNS Records option.",30

Introduction to Order Statuses,"Order statuses are important in CloudCart because different events occur based on the order status, such as inventory reduction, customer notifications, and invoice creation. Understanding the intricacies of order statuses is essential for both you and your merchants.",38
Three Main Statuses,"In CloudCart, an order has three main statuses: (1) fulfillment status, which indicates whether an order has been fulfilled or not; (2) payment status, which can have various sub-statuses such as completed, declined, pending, and refunded; and (3) the main order status, which is determined based on the fulfillment and payment status.",52
Offline Payment Methods,"An order's status can be ""pending"" when an offline payment method is used, such as cash on delivery, bank transfers, or other offline payment methods that will be added in the future. Offline payment methods do not involve direct payment or payment verification, so the status remains ""pending"" until the merchant takes further action.",54
Preparing and Shipping an Order with Offline Payment Methods,"When an order is placed with an offline payment method, the merchant is expected to perform actions such as preparing the shipment and packaging the order. In this case, the status will be ""pending,"" and the merchant can update the order status to ""fulfilled"" when they have prepared the order for shipping.",52
Updating the Payment Status,"The payment status can be updated manually by the merchant when using offline payment methods. For example, when an order is placed with cash on delivery, the merchant needs to confirm the payment and mark the order as paid to update the overall order status.",45
Updating Order Status to Fulfilled,"When you mark an order as fulfilled, the order status will change accordingly, and the customer will receive an email notification about their fulfilled order. Depending on the settings you have chosen, the available stock for the ordered items may be reduced at this point.",45
Adjusting Inventory Reduction Settings,"You can configure when the inventory should be reduced: either when the order status is ""pending"" and ""fulfilled"" or when it's ""paid"" and ""fulfilled."" This setting can be adjusted based on your preferences and the type of payment methods you primarily work with.",43
Inventory Reduction for Cash on Delivery Orders,"If you predominantly work with cash on delivery orders and have chosen the ""pending"" and ""fulfilled"" setting for inventory reduction, the available stock for the ordered items will be immediately reduced once the order is placed. However, if you have chosen the ""paid"" and ""fulfilled"" setting, the stock will only be reduced when the order is marked as paid or fulfilled.",61
Inventory Reduction for Directly Paid Orders,"If an order is placed with a direct payment method, such as a credit card, the inventory reduction will depend on the settings you have chosen. With the ""pending"" and ""fulfilled"" setting, the inventory will not be reduced immediately upon placing the order, but rather when the order is marked as fulfilled. On the other hand, if you have selected the ""paid"" and ""fulfilled"" setting, the inventory will be reduced as soon as the order is marked as fulfilled.",79
Order Status Transitions,"An order should not transition back to a ""pending"" status once it has been marked as ""paid."" The ""pending"" status is the initial status of an order, and it should only progress through the subsequent stages (e.g., ""fulfilled"" and ""paid"") to reflect the actual state of the order. Proper management of order statuses is crucial for maintaining accurate inventory and ensuring a smooth order processing experience for both the merchant and the customer.",73
Shipment and Additional Order Status,"Once an order is marked as fulfilled, a shipping notice or invoice may be generated and sent to the customer, along with any other relevant notifications (e.g., via email, Messenger, Viber, or any other connected platform). Customers can also assign other order statuses, such as ""canceled"" or ""refund issued."" It's important to note that once an order is marked as fulfilled, its status cannot be changed back to ""pending""",69
Canceling and Refunding a Shipped Order,"To cancel or refund a fulfilled order, you can use the available options within the order management interface. When an order is marked as both ""fulfilled"" and ""canceled,"" this indicates that the order has been fulfilled but later canceled. Keep in mind that orders marked as ""fulfilled"" cannot have their shipping or billing addresses modified.",55
Modifying Unshipped Orders,"To modify an order's shipping or billing address, the order must be marked as ""unfulfilled."" You can perform this action by selecting the appropriate status within the order management interface. Once an order is marked as ""unfulfilled,"" you'll be able to edit the necessary information.",45
Payment Statuses,"In addition to order statuses, payment statuses are another crucial aspect of order management. Understanding and managing payment statuses accurately ensures a smooth and efficient order processing experience for both the merchant and the customer.",35
Marking an Order as Paid,"When marking an order as paid (in this case, using cash on delivery), you will be asked to enter a reference number. Once an order is marked as paid, it can never be marked as unpaid again. This restriction is in place to prevent merchants from manipulating the platform and to ensure compliance with legal requirements in various countries, such as Bulgaria.",62
Canceling or Refunding a Paid Order,"While you cannot mark a paid order as unpaid, you can still cancel or refund it. If you attempt to cancel an order that has already been paid, you may receive a notification stating that only open orders can be canceled. In this case, you can't cancel the order, but you can issue a refund. This process might involve contacting the customer, who may have requested the cancellation of their order over the phone, and confirming that they will not receive the order. If the order was marked as paid, you can't cancel it, but you can issue a refund and record the refund as processed.",106
Returning to the Original Status of an Order,"Once you have marked an order as paid, it will be shown as such in the order management interface. When preparing the order for shipment, the system will update the order status to ""completed"" after the order has been fulilled and payment has been received. At this point, there is no further action required for this order. The system automatically marks an order as completed when both the shipping and payment statuses are in a positive state (i.e., the shipping status is marked as ""fulilled"" and the payment status is marked as ""paid""). When these conditions are met, the order is considered completed and can be seen as such in the order management interface. Completed orders can only be archived.",120
Understanding Order Status and Archive Function,"In the order management interface, you can filter orders by their status, such as ""completed"" orders. Completed orders that appear in gray indicate that they have been archived. Archiving an order allows you to remove it from active processing, but still retain its information for future reference.",47
Unarchiving and Editing Archived Orders,"To unarchive an order, simply select the appropriate action within the order management interface. Once unarchived, you can perform various operations on the order, such as editing and updating its status. Keep in mind that while an order is archived, it cannot be edited or have its status changed. Instead, you can only view its history and access its associated invoice. Unarchiving the order will enable you to perform additional actions as needed.",73
Using Filters to Manage Orders,"Within the order management interface, you can use various filters to view orders based on their status, payment method, or delivery status. This allows you to easily manage and prioritize orders according to your business needs.",36
Two Main Groups of Statuses,"There are two main groups of statuses in the system: system-generated statuses and custom statuses added by the client. System-generated statuses include order status, delivery status, and payment status. You can also add your own custom statuses to the main order status to better manage and categorize your orders.",49
Adding Custom Statuses,"Custom statuses allow you to mark orders that require special attention, such as those needing additional processing or follow-up. By using custom statuses, you can easily filter and view orders that need further action. Custom statuses can be added to the main order status and can be used for filtering orders in the future. However, custom statuses do not trigger email notifications to customers.",64
Webhooks and Status Notifications,"While custom statuses do not send email notifications to customers, they can initiate the sending of webhook messages. Webhooks are a powerful tool for transferring information from one software environment to another. System-generated statuses, on the other hand, send email notifications to customers to inform them about the status of their orders. In summary, all statuses, whether system-generated or custom, can be sent via webhooks, but only system-generated statuses trigger email notifications to customers.",74
Understanding Order Statuses,"Orders have three main statuses: shipping status, payment status, and overall order status. The shipping status can be either ""Fulfilled"" or ""Not fulfilled"" The payment status has several types, which are determined by the corresponding payment provider. If there is no payment provider, it is considered an offline payment method.",50
Payment Status Types,"Payment status types include ""Completed,"" ""Cancelled,"" ""Expired,"" ""Disputed,"" ""Frozen,"" ""Pending,"" ""Requested,"" and ""Initiated."" These statuses come from electronic payment methods and are system-generated.",23
Combining Shipping and Payment Statuses,"The overall order status combines both the shipping and payment statuses. For example, an order can have a ""Fulfilled"" shipping status but an ""Unpaid"" payment status, or it can have a ""Paid"" payment status but a ""Not Shipped"" shipping status. Separating these statuses into three categories allows merchants to easily understand the current state of each order and enables the online store software to relay this information to other systems in real-time. This enables a wide range of functionalities and allows for the implementation of necessary business logic.",88
