Importance of Unique Titles,Unique titles and descriptions are crucial for ranking at the highest level in search engine results. The search engine decides which listings to place on top of the search results based on meta titles and meta descriptions.,---
Bulk Editing,The tool allows you to manipulate specific categories of products and give them variables to construct whole titles and descriptions. You don't have to go through each product one by one.,---
Using the Tool,"To use the tool, go to Applications or Apps and search for ""SEO spinner."" Install the spinner, which is built by CloudCart, for SEO optimization. You will see three tabs: Products, Categories, and Brands. They all work the same way. In this example, we'll focus on manipulating product data.",---
Variables and Conditions,"You can add variables and conditions to specify which categories you're working with, and the system will generate titles and descriptions accordingly. Be careful not to duplicate categories from one condition to another.",---
Creating Unique Titles,"To create unique titles, you can mix text and variables. You can also use different patterns for different products. To specify different variations for specific categories, add them within the conditions.",---
Creating Unique Descriptions,"The same process applies to descriptions. You can use variables, text, and variations to create unique descriptions. You can also use curly brackets and semicolons to create variations of keywords, phrases, or sentences.",---
Saving and Generating Combinations,"Once you have created your conditions and patterns, save your condition and click ""Override All Data"" to apply these changes to your products. Then, generate all combinations and wait for the system to process them.",---
Preview and Edit,"You can preview the generated combinations and edit specific titles and descriptions if needed. Once you're satisfied with the results, click ""Finalize"" to apply the changes to all your products.",---
Size Chart Application,"To get the size chart feature, we need to go to applications and search for the size chart application built by CloudCart. This application is a paid application. Once it is installed, the merchants will be able to define the size charts before doing so, prepare the landing pages for the size charts. To create the size chart pages, go to marketing landing pages and build the landing pages.",---
Creating Size Charts,"The title of the size chart is only for internal use to orientate for what the chart is for. The second title is visible for the users, so make sure it is a good and readable title. Select the category, and only the products under that category will show that title. If there is a specific vendor, select that as well. Hit save, and the particular page is created.",---
Product Pages,"To see which products have that page, go to the product page and check. If the size chart is visible, then the page is enabled. If the size chart is not visible, then the page is not enabled. The size chart is only applicable for the products that are under the selected category. If there is no category, unfortunately, it cannot be assigned. The size chart page will only be visible on products under that category or category and vendor.",---
Conclusion,Using the size chart application is way more powerful than the previous functionality. It is simple but a better way to present the products with the exact number of sizes based on the category or category and vendor. The whole concept is to define specific size charts on specific categories or vendors based on specific criteria.,---
Example,"Triggered products can be used to send messages to customers who browse products under a specific category. For example, you can send a message with three or four or eight discounted products from that category or a dynamic discount promo code for a specific product. This will encourage customers to make a purchase and improve their shopping experience.",---
Trigger,"The trigger for a campaign is the segment, which is a set of conditions that a visitor or customer must enter or exit to activate the campaign. The conditions for triggered products should relate to the products in your store. The trigger can be purchases, cart, subscribed products, memberships, product reviews, or wish lists.",---
Campaign,"To create a campaign for triggered products, select the appropriate segment and use the triggered product widget to include products related to the segment. You can then build a contextual email with a dynamic discount code to encourage customers to make a purchase.",---
What are Web Hooks?,"Web hooks are a feature in CloudCart that enable events in the store to be sent outside the store to a third-party application. As soon as an event occurs, such as a new order, the web hook will fire an event and transfer information regarding the order, such as customer details, shipping information, or product information, to the third-party application.",---
Benefits of Web Hooks,"The benefits of web hooks are that they fill the gap between software in the e-commerce store and software for inventory management or other third-party applications. Web hooks provide a missing piece of the puzzle in two-way integrations with third-party applications, which ensures that information related to events such as orders, product updates, or customer registration is sent immediately without waiting even for a second.",---
Setting Up Web Hooks,"Web hooks can be set up under the settings menu in the web hooks section. The first step is to select an API key to give web hooks permission to run and fire events based on the key. The second step is to select the destination URL, where the information related to the events will be sent. There is a service called webhooks.site, which allows testing the destination URL and events for webhooks.",---
Testing Web Hooks,"Web hooks can be tested by editing orders or products and ensuring that the events are immediately fired and transferred to the third-party application. Web hooks can also be tested with services such as webhooks.site, which provide a destination URL for testing.",---
Real-Time Integration Example,"An example of real-time integration using web hooks is a service that provides tickets for public transport. As soon as the order is validated with the paid status, a QR code is generated, and the customer receives it instantly. This is a real-time integration between the store and the third-party application.",---
Conclusion,"CloudCart web hooks are a powerful and professional way to make a two-way real-time event integration between two or more applications. It provides valuable information in real-time, which can be used for inventory management, order management, or other integrations. More information can be found at help.cloudcart.com.",---
Product Statuses,"Go to the ""Products"" page and select ""Product Statuses"". By default, the platform has ""In Stock"" and ""Out of Stock"" statuses. To enable the subscription feature, you can either add an ""Out of Stock"" status and change its behavior or add a new status. We recommend using the default ""Out of Stock"" status and changing the action from ""Select new"" to ""Show as subscribed for quantity"". Change the name of the status to ""Notify me when available"" or any other desired name.",---
Subscribing to an Out of Stock Product,"Once the product status is set up, go to a product that is currently out of stock. The product page will display a ""Notify me when available"" button, which allows users to subscribe to the product.",---
Creating a Segment,"To collect all subscribers for out of stock products, go to ""Marketing Campaigns"" and select ""Segments"". Create a new segment using the ""Subscribed for product availability"" condition. This condition is simple and effective, but you can add additional conditions if desired.",---
Creating a Campaign,"Go to ""Marketing Campaigns"" and select ""Automated Campaigns"". Create a new campaign with a title and enable the ""Repeat this campaign for customers who got into it for more than once"" option. Select the previously created segment. Choose the appropriate action type and channel, such as Viber or web push notifications, and create the message template. The template can include variables, such as the triggered product, which will be based on the specific actions of your store and users. Add any desired additional steps, such as checking if the link was clicked, and specify the goal of the campaign. Once the campaign is started, it will automatically notify users when their subscribed product is back in stock.",---
Mandatory Things to Know,"This setup is irreversible, so you cannot undo your product catalog settings. The system will start a procedure which will split all variant values and create different products based on the variant value that you're going to split. For example, if you split by color, you will have different products based on each color variant. This option is payable.",---
Steps to Split Variants,"Go to the products main menu and then the variants menu. Select the option that will split all products that contain the variant option you want to split (in this case, color). Turn on the setting and name each product with its variant value. When you save, the system will start a procedure to split all products based on their color.",---
Viewing the Split Products,"After the procedure is complete, you will have different products based on each color variant. Each product will contain the name of the color value, and you can showcase all your colors on the listing pages. When a customer selects a color, the color will be automatically selected and reflected in the checkout page as a variant option.",---
Important Details,Product feeds and applications that generate product content like CSB or XML files will be affected by this feature. All product feeds will have to be regenerated. This feature is a great way to showcase all your products in a different way.,---
Functionality,"The Suppliers application allows merchants to have multiple suppliers for different products, each with their own prices and availability. The application allows for easy comparison of delivery prices and identification of the best supplier for a particular product.",---
Setting up Suppliers,"To add suppliers manually, go to the product section and click on the ""Suppliers"" link. Here, you can add as many suppliers as you wish and assign them to specific products. Alternatively, you can use the XML import application to automatically import products and assign them to suppliers.",---
Adding Suppliers to Products,"When adding suppliers manually, go to the product detail page and select the supplier from the dropdown menu. You can also assign a delivery price and an identification number for both your store and the supplier's store.",---
Tracking Inventory,"CloudCart can track product inventory at the supplier's store, and merchants can disable a specific supplier for a product if they are out of stock.",---
Order Products,Merchants can use the Order Products feature to filter by supplier and make bulk orders for all products under a specific supplier.,---
Benefits,"The Suppliers application allows for easy comparison of delivery prices, determination of the best supplier for a product, and automation of product catalog and pricing for different merchants.",---
Product Inventory Section,"The product inventory section allows you to manage your product inventory. You can use the filter option to search for a product by SKU, barcode, or product description. You can also filter products by category and quantity. Additionally, you can save filters and use them as tabs for quick searches and filter options.",---
Importance of Managing Inventory,"It is essential to manage your inventory to have a clear visibility of what's inside the warehouse, what's in stock in the online store, and what is out of stock in the product catalog. CloudCart focuses on delivering functionality that is really important when you are not working with warehouse software.",---
Product Listing Page,"The product listing page represents your product inventory. The difference between the inventory and the product section is that we split the product variants into products because each line here represents a product and its variations. For example, a product can have several variations between size and color, which we represent in a list of each product variation and each combination of that variation.",---
Managing Quantities,"To manage quantities, you can add or set a quantity for each product variation. Adding a quantity increases the number of products in stock, while setting a quantity replaces the existing quantity with the new number. You can also decrease or increase the quantity by a specific number.",---
Filters and Criteria,"You can use filters and criteria to manage your inventory. For example, you can select specific SKUs or filter products that are out of stock. This is helpful when you want to enable continuous selling for products that are out of stock because you know they will be restocked soon.",---
Using Categories,"Categories help you manage your inventory by organizing products by vendors, manufacturers, subcategories, etc. You can easily manage categories by adding new ones and subcategories, which makes it easier to find specific products.",---
Adding a Category,"To add a category, go to the side panel and provide data such as the name and description of the category. The URL address is generated automatically but can be edited. The system will check for duplicate names. A handy feature is the automatic 301 redirects if you change the URL slug when editing a record.",---
Category Description,You can add a description to your category using the text editor. You can also make the category a child of a parent category or add an image to the category.,---
Google Taxonomy,"Google taxonomy is a required field to define categories in product feeds. It will be used as the name of the category, no matter what name you choose for it. You can choose the taxonomy definition from a search bar.",---
Subcategories,You can add subcategories to a category in two ways: by adding a category and choosing the parent category or by dragging and dropping an existing category to the parent category. You can also merge two categories to make them parent and child.,---
Displaying Subcategories,"You can display subcategories in your storefront by enabling the function on your new category listing. If a category has no products, it will not appear on the storefront.",---
Category Properties,"You can access category properties from the category view. If you see warnings, it means the categories were not defined by the taxonomy, and you should define them to generate product feeds.",---
Improving SEO,Adding text and images to your categories is a great way to improve your SEO and get ahead of your competitors. Relevant keywords in the category description also help in search results.,---
Understanding Brands and Vendors,"Vendors and brands are filters that are useful for navigation through the products. Brands refer to the company or manufacturer of the product. In CloudCart, it is easy to upload the brand logo, brand description, and meta title and description.",---
Vendor Page,"Each brand has its own page, where all the products that are into that brand are listed. Once a brand has been created, you can click on the brand and you will be redirected to the page of the vendor.",---
Benefits of Having a Vendor Page,"Vendor pages are useful in increasing the visibility of the website into the search results of Google. For example, if someone searches for a particular brand, your website will be ranked higher in the search results due to the presence of the vendor page.",---
Brand Page,"The brand page is the place where you can read the text about the brand, some sort of information about the brand, and the logo.",---
Mandatory Brand for Products,"It is not mandatory to choose a brand for a product, and products can be displayed without anything under them.",---
Defining Smart Collections,"Smart collections are a way to combine different products based on specific criteria into a single page, without the need to manually select each individual product. This feature can save time and effort, especially when dealing with a large number of products.",---
Creating a Smart Collection,"To create a smart collection, start by giving it a title that represents the criteria you want to apply. You can also add SEO descriptions and titles from the same page. Next, select the criteria you want to use, such as specific products, categories, discounts, brands, or taxes. You can also use operators such as ""not in"" to exclude products from certain categories.",---
Tagging Products,"You can also use tagging to create a smart collection. For example, you can tag products that are meant to be included in a specific collection with a unique tag, and then create a smart collection that includes all products with that tag. This is particularly useful when dealing with large numbers of products.",---
Using Smart Collections,"Smart collections can be used in various ways, such as creating discounts, showcasing products, generating feeds for selected parties, and more. They can also be used to build landing pages that feature a specific collection of products. When used smartly, smart collections can save time and effort and provide a seamless shopping experience for your customers.",---
Conclusion,"Smart collections are a powerful feature unique to CloudCart that allows you to combine different products based on specific criteria into a single page. By understanding the functionality of smart collections, you can use them to save time and effort and provide a better shopping experience for your customers.",---
Getting Started with Product Bundles,"To use product bundles, you need to install the Product Bundles application from the All Applications menu in your store's Ups menu. Once installed, you can find it in the Products menu under Bundles. Initially, you won't have any bundles, but you can start creating them from here.",---
Bundle Setup,"Setting up a bundle is a manual process, and you need to tell the system how to combine the products and how to present them. From the Advanced Settings menu, you can set the bundle's title, upload an image, and write a description. You can also choose which products to include in the bundle and set the bundle's price.",---
Bundle Configuration,"Once you've selected your products and set the bundle price, you can configure how the bundle appears on your storefront. You can change the page title and description for the bundle, set validation dates, and even show a timer to encourage customers to buy before the bundle expires. You can also choose how the bundle appears on your storefront, such as a list of products or a product listing in the landing page.",---
Advanced Settings,"In the Advanced Settings menu, you can make further customizations to the bundle. For example, you can change the quantity of a product in the bundle or change the order of the products. You can also check CloudCart's Health Center for more information on bundle functionalities.",---
Conclusion,"Product bundles are a great way to increase your store's average order value, and CloudCart offers a variety of options for setting them up and customizing their appearance. If you have any questions or want to practice your knowledge, you can always reach out to CloudCart's support team.",---
Introduction,"how to add properties to your products in order to make them more searchable, filterable, and organized. Properties are features that can describe a product in a convenient way, allowing users to filter and search based on specific criteria.",---
Category Properties,"Category properties are features assigned to specific categories and can be reused for different products. CloudCart offers three methods to import category properties into your store: manual entry, XML import, and CloudCart APIs. Manual entry is the slowest method, while XML import and CloudCart APIs are much faster.",---
Adding Category Properties,"To add category properties manually, go to the products main page and select category properties. You can add a new property here, give it a name, type, and assign it to specific categories. You can also assign values for that property. Once you're ready, save the property and it will be recorded in the system. You can add as many category properties as you wish.",---
Merging Values,"CloudCart offers a feature called merging values that allows you to merge more than two values into one value, especially helpful when working with large sets of data. To merge values, select the values to be merged, and CloudCart will combine them into a single value. You can also assign an image to each property value, making it easier for users to search and filter your products.",---
Assigning Category Properties to Products,"Once you have created your category properties, you can assign them to specific products. Go to the product's page and select the product you want to assign properties to. Click the ""Category Specific Properties"" button and enter the property values. Once you're ready, submit the properties and publish the changes. You can then filter and search for products based on their properties.",---
Adding Category Properties Manually,"To add category properties manually, go to the ""Category Properties"" tab in your CloudCart store, click ""Add Property,"" and fill in the necessary details. Once you have added the property, you can add values to it by clicking on it.",---
Using Category Properties as Filters,"Once you have added your category properties and values to your products, you can use them as filters by going to ""Category Properties"" and selecting which properties to activate as filters.",---
Showing Specific Category Properties,"To show specific category properties on a product page, go to ""Widgets > Products"" in your store and select ""Show category properties here"" and ""Show category properties with images in sidebar."" Then, select an image for each value.",---
Choosing Category Properties,"After selecting a category, you can choose category properties. These are attributes of the category, and their values are attributes of a product. Category properties are predefined in the Category Properties menu.",---
Purpose of Category Properties,"Category properties display the main characteristics of a product. They cannot be changed or chosen by the customer, as they are constant facts about the product. These properties can be used for filtering products in the catalog and providing more information about the product. However, they cannot be chosen when purchasing a product. Consider the example of buying a TV. Attributes such as screen size, technology (LCD, OLED), and resolution (4K, 8K) are category properties. These specifications are fixed and cannot be chosen by the customer. They help users filter through the product catalog and narrow down their search to find the desired product.",---
Creating Category Properties,"To choose a category property, it must be created beforehand. To do this, navigate to the Category Property menu, create a new property (e.g., resolution), and specify its values. Once created, you can assign these properties and their values to products.",---
Multiple Values for a Property,"It is possible to select more than one value for a single property, although specific use cases may vary. This feature allows for flexibility in representing product attributes.",---
Methods of getting information out,"There are three major methods of getting information out of the store. The first one is by downloading a CSV file, which is a basic method for downloading orders, invoices or customers, but it cannot handle a large amount of product catalog data. The second method is through XML files, which is the most popular way of getting information out of the store. The third method is using the CloudCart API, which allows merchants to extract data programmatically by making requests.",---
Purpose of getting information out,"The purpose of getting information out of the store is to synchronize product catalogs with third-party applications, supply partners with relevant information regarding stock levels or pricing, and provide resellers with valuable information. XML feeds are useful for feeding Facebook or Google or any other third-party application with the product catalog of the store to make advertisements based on the behaviors of their merchants. There are a lot of possibilities and scenarios regarding why XML feeds are so important for the merchants.",---
CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator,"The CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator is a powerful tool for generating different product feeds with different types of information. To start, a merchant needs to create a new XML feed by giving it a name. The merchant can then filter down the products based on specific criteria, such as by category, brand, smart collection, or tax. Password protection is also available to secure information getting out from the hands of partners.",---
Configuring CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator,"The CloudCart Product XML Feed Generator has options for tracking purposes, such as for tracking the actions of customers that came from a partner website. The settings for turning off and on are for product quantities, product discount price, append hidden products, and append out of stock products. Once the merchant is happy with the settings, they can hit save, and a job is created to produce the XML file. The generation of the XML feed is incremental by 12 hours, and the content will be different if there are differences.",---
Purchasing Additional Products,"To purchase additional products, users can click on the ""Purchase"" button, which will redirect them to the pricing lists. From there, they can select the quantity of products they want for their XML files. It's important to note that any limitation applied to purchasing products will apply to all feeds, not just specific ones. So, if a user has five product feeds, all 45 product feeds will have a limitation on the number of products.",---
Product Feed Overview,"Once the product feed is ready, users can view it and see information such as the product name, address, category, and pricing. The price displayed may be discounted, as users can set up discounts for specific merchants. There will be no reference to quantities, only the stock availability. The XML feed generator is a powerful tool for dealing with product catalogs and sharing information with partners or resellers.",---
Unique XML Feed Generator,"CloudCart's XML feed generator is a unique feature that is not commonly found in the e-commerce world. Many services offer this feature as an additional service or application. However, CloudCart's XML feed generator is included out of the box and seamlessly integrates with users' stores.",---
Facebook Product Catalog,CloudCart's Facebook Dynamic Ads application creates a product XML feed used for building a product catalog directly into Facebook Business Manager. The purpose of creating the XML feed is to create and manage remarketing campaigns on Facebook. Merchants can read more about how to set up the product feed on CloudCart's Health Center.,---
Google Merchant Feed,Google Merchant Feed is used to drive Google Ads marketing campaigns with products.

Installation,"Once you pay and install the application, you will be forwarded to a page where you have to grant access to CloudCart to your specific Google Drive where your files will be stored. You will then work with your Google Spreadsheet.",---
Discount Option,"The Google Sheets integration has a discount option that automatically imports discounts on every single product. You simply need to select the discount you have already created. Products that are imported or updated from Google Sheets with the ""discount price"" field will create discounts in the store.",---
Filter Options,"There are three filter options in the integration. ""All products"" means all products will be imported into Google Sheets. ""Filter by category"" allows you to select a specific category to work with and the products only from that category or categories will be uploaded. ""Filter by products"" means that you can select specific products to upload into Google Sheets.",---
Selecting Columns,"You can specify which columns of the products you want to upload to Google Sheets. If you don't select any, the entire product catalog with all the columns will be uploaded. This is done because Google Sheets has a limitation of five million cells per document, which can be easily exceeded with a large product catalog.",---
Opening Google Sheets,"Once you click the button to open your spreadsheet, you will be redirected to the product table at Google Sheets. The table will have headings for columns such as product ID and product name, and under that, you will see all the products with their IDs and names.",---
Manipulating Data,"You can use formulas to manipulate the data and change product titles, quantities, pricing, and more. You can even have pictures and import products from Google Sheets. If you leave the ""Product ID"" field blank, a new product will be created for you with a brand new ID. However, be careful when working with Google Sheets, as you can easily mess up your entire store and product catalog.",---
Exporting Data,"You must spend as little time as possible between uploading and downloading the product catalog to avoid any discrepancies caused by new orders or other changes. It is also recommended to remove quantities if you are not going to work with them to avoid any issues. If you change the name of the columns, you can run into problems, so it's best to avoid changing them.",---
Restrictions,"One minor restriction is that you can only add simple products, not multiple variations. You can also only add products to a fixed discount or a simple discount. The integration allows you to use structure with special symbols to show that a category is a subcategory, but there is no reference to the categories themselves.",---
Pricing,"To sell a product, you need to set its price. In CloudCart's user interface, you will find several fields that are mandatory for dealing with products, one of which is the price. SKUs are another important field, as they are used for synchronization with other applications for product updates, such as pricing and quantities. SKUs can be identified using barcodes, product IDs, or other means.",---
Product Variation,"Product variation refers to the different versions of a product that are available, such as different colors or sizes. In CloudCart, variations are set up in a table format, with one row per product variation. In this way, merchants can have many variations of one product model, such as a sweater, in different colors and sizes. We will now explain how to set up product variations in CloudCart's user interface.",---
Product Variation Setup,"To set up product variations in CloudCart, you can use a radio button, drop-down menu, image sample, or color sample. Radio buttons are best for fewer variations, while drop-down menus are better for more. Image samples are best for presenting different product colors, and color samples are best for presenting different product sizes. You can choose the type of variation you want to use in the ""Variant Type"" dropdown menu. You can also add images, SKUs, barcodes, quantities, and pricing for each variation in the table.",---
Product Variation Presentation,"Product variations are presented differently depending on the variation type you choose. For example, radio buttons are best for presenting fewer variations, while drop-down menus are better for presenting more. Image samples are best for presenting different product colors, and color samples are best for presenting different product sizes. You can also use a banner or small image to present variations in a more artistic way, depending on the product. Keep in mind that the presentation of product variations should be easy to understand for the customer.",---
Creating Variations,"To create a product variant, you can combine different options together. For example, if you have two options for size and two options for color, the system will combine each size with each color to create a matrix of product variations. You can select up to three product variations and up to 150 values per variation.",---
Using Quick Filters,"Quick filters can be used to easily select all options for a product. To use this feature, select the options you want and then enter a price for all.",---
Limitations,CloudCart has limitations on the number of product variations you can create. You can have up to three product variations with up to 150 values per variation.,---
Presentation Styles,"CloudCart offers different presentation styles for product variations, including radio buttons, color swatches, and table views. The speaker recommends using the most commonly used presentation style, which is a combination of color and size options.",---
Numerical Options,"CloudCart also offers numerical options for products, which can be useful for representing size and other numerical values. These options are presented in two dimensions, with the first representing the numeric value and the second representing the alpha value.",---
Using Category Properties,"If you have a product with only one value for an option, it is recommended to present this as a category property rather than a product variant. Category properties can also be presented with images in the sidebar.",---
Translations,"If you want to change the name of a feature, you can do so by going to the Translations section in the settings and searching for the feature name.",---
Adding Product Options,"To add a new product option, go to the product options menu and click ""Add New."" You will see two fields for the name: one for internal use to orientate in the product options menu and the other will be visible in the storefront. Add a label for the product option and choose if it's required or not. Choose the option type (image, text field, checkbox, etc.) and set a price if necessary. In the ""Connection"" field, choose the product or category to apply this option to, and then save the changes.",---
Testing Product Options,"After adding the product options, go to the product page in the storefront to see how they appear. Make sure to test the options by selecting different choices and checking if the price changes accordingly. Ensure that required options prompt a warning if they are not filled out before adding the product to the cart.",---
Rearranging Product Options,"If needed, rearrange the order of the product options by going to the product options menu and dragging and dropping the options to the desired order. You can also rearrange the values and roles that you added on a specific product option.",---
Introduction to Product Options,"In this guide, we will present the ability to add product options in CloudCart. Product options are additional features or choices that can be added to a product details page. They can modify the price of a product or remain free. However, product options do not have SKUs, and their quantity is not tracked.",---
Example Scenario,"For instance, you might be selling gifts for kids and want to offer customers the option to add a gift wrap, a happy birthday card, or customize the product with a name. These options are not mandatory, but they can bring added value to the product and potentially increase the order value.",---
Adding a Product Option,"To add a product option, go to the product options menu, and click on ""Add New Product Option"". Fill in the name for internal use and the name for the storefront. Choose if the option is required, the option type (such as image, text, or checkbox), and if there's an additional value associated with the option. Finally, select the product or category to which the option will be applied, and save.",---
Example: Custom Image and Text,"In this example, we will add two product options to a keychain that can have a custom photo and text. The first option will allow customers to upload an image, and the second option will let them input custom text. Both options will be required and free.",---
Example: Gift Wrap Option,"The third product option will be a paid option for gift wrapping. This option will not be required, and customers can choose from different wrapping options with associated prices. This option can be added as an image selection with single selection enabled.",---
Testing and Adjusting Options,"After setting up the product options, test them in the storefront to ensure they work as expected. Make any necessary adjustments,",---
Application Stores: Local Pickup,"The local pickup application offers three main features: enabling a shipping method for local pickup, allowing local payment, and providing the ability to add quantity per product for each store. This is especially useful for merchants with multiple warehouse locations or physical stores in different cities or locations within a city.",---
Store Quantities and Geolocation,"By knowing the quantities for each location and their physical addresses, you can define locations at your online store and assign them to your physical locations. This allows customers to see only the products that are in stock for a specific store that offers delivery to their address, making it convenient for customers and helping merchants manage their inventory more efficiently.",---
Setting Up Stores and Quantities,"To begin, you'll need to add your stores within the application. Once your stores are added, you can then add the quantities of your products per store. You can do this in two ways: through XML synchronization or via CloudCart's API. Both methods allow you to easily import and synchronize your product quantities per store.",---
Shipping and Payment Options,"You can set up local pickup as a shipping method and select the stores that accept local pickup. Additionally, you can choose which payment provider will be used for local pickup, allowing customers to pay at the store if desired.",---
Local Pickup and Geolocation in Action,"By combining local pickup, product quantities per store, geolocation, and customized shipping and payment options, you can create a seamless experience for your customers, whether they prefer to shop online or in person. This is particularly beneficial for brick-and-mortar merchants and those in the grocery industry.",---
Identifying the Product Catalog Source,"The first step in managing your product catalog is to identify the source of your products. There are several concepts to consider, such as manually importing or uploading products, which has already been covered in previous videos. This guide focuses on managing your product catalog with external sources, where some automation and centralization are needed. You need to understand the entire chain of getting products from an external source and importing them into CloudCart.",---
Understanding the Structure of Data,"Next, you need to understand the structure of the information you are going to receive and import into the online store. This information should include product name or title, description, categories, information about the vendor or manufacturer, pricing, inventory levels, and any other relevant field options. This understanding will help you create a comprehensive and efficient process for importing product data into your online store.",---
Identifying Data Sources,"You must also identify how many data sources there are for your product catalog. Understanding whether there is a single source or multiple channels from which you will receive information about your products is crucial. If you are working with multiple data sources for a single product catalog, you need to decide which is the main source and how to handle the rest. This will help you to aggregate information from different sources and import it into your store effectively.",---
Managing Prices from Different Sources,"When dealing with different prices from different suppliers, you must decide which supplier offers the best price and whether you want to override the prices from different suppliers or vendors. This will ensure that you can sell your products at the best possible price while keeping track of inventory levels and supplier information.",---
Importing and Exporting Data,"CloudCart is a software with inputs and outputs, meaning that you can import and export data related to products, categories, or any other relational structures. This can be done on an event-driven basis or at specific times. It is important to note that importing orders is not currently possible in CloudCart due to the complexity and relationships involved in order data. However, understanding how to import and export data effectively is essential for managing your product catalog and ensuring that your online store operates smoothly.",---
Data Entry Methods,"There are several methods for importing data into CloudCart. For customers, you can use CSV imports or API. For products, there are many more ways, including using external data sources and automating the process. Understanding these different data entry methods will help you choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs and ensure that your product catalog is managed effectively.",---
CSV (Comma Separated Values),"CSV is a simple and basic data format, which is essentially a spreadsheet or table type of data saved by comma-separated values. This format is popular for transferring information and is commonly used with old-fashioned software like warehousing or ERP systems. CSV is suitable for one-time imports due to its basic structure, but it's essential to have unique identifiers for each product record to avoid issues with synchronizing data.",---
XML (eXtensible Markup Language),"XML is a more structured data format that uses tags and data, making it easier for software to read and import products. It is a standard and non-standard format, allowing flexibility in how data is organized. XML is ideal for continuous syncing of data and requires unique identifiers for each product record. We have a dedicated help article detailing the structure and import process into CloudCart.",---
API (Application Programming Interface),"CloudCart's API provides a more advanced way to communicate with the store and manipulate data. It enables programmers outside CloudCart to access and manage product data, categories, customers, orders, and more. The API is well-documented and available for paid plans only. Using the API allows greater flexibility and control over importing and syncing products.",---
Google Sheets,"Google Sheets is another method for importing products, offering a user-friendly spreadsheet interface for uploading and downloading products, manipulating data, and managing quantities and prices. CloudCart has a comprehensive help article related to Google Sheets, and the application is suitable for basic users.",---
Unique Identifiers,"It is crucial to define unique identifiers for each product record when importing and syncing data. These identifiers can be SKU, barcode, or external ID, but never the product name. Unique identifiers allow software to find, update, or import products accurately. Without them, you may end up with duplicate or incorrect product data.",---
European System Integrations and Dropshipping Models,"CloudCart supports more than ten European ERP integrations, offering built-in synchronization and import options for merchants using specific ERP systems. Dropshipping models, like Brands Distribution, allow merchants to import and sell products without storing them. XML files can also be used for dropshipping. Some integrations and models are specific to certain vendors and may vary in functionality.",---
CSV to XML Conversion,"CloudCart offers a service to convert CSV files to XML format, allowing merchants to import and sync data using the more structured XML format. This process involves taking the CSV file, converting it to XML, and then importing it back into CloudCart using applications like XML Import or XML Sink. This service can help standardize data output for merchants and automate processes.",---
Introduction to Selling Digital Products,"In the digital era, merchants are seeking solutions to sell their products, coaching materials, and online courses. CloudCart's infrastructure and platform accommodate different digital online stores and retailers.",---
Types of Digital Products,"There are two types of digital products: 1) Files, such as music, videos, eBooks, or any downloadable content; and 2) Resources, which provide membership access or restricted area access for customers who have paid for the content.",---
Store Setup for Digital Products,"When setting up an online store for digital products, consider if it will be oriented solely towards digital products or a mixture of digital and physical products. For example, a retailer selling computers may also sell digital licenses.",---
Cart and Checkout Settings,"Pay attention to cart and checkout settings. If your store focuses on digital products, disable the ""require shipping address on registration"" option. Turn off guest checkout and set your store for members only to grant customers access for later usage. Decide if you require a billing address for issuing invoices or not. Remember that requesting a billing address may slow down the purchasing process.",---
Adding Digital Products,"To add a digital product, follow the same steps as adding a physical product, but select ""Digital"" under product configuration. Choose the type of digital product (file or resource), and upload the file, if applicable. You cannot require shipping for digital products, but you can track inventory. However, you cannot have variations for digital products.",---
Checkout Process for Digital Products,"When checking out with digital products, the shipping address step is skipped, and customers are directed to the payment method selection. After completing the order, customers can download the product files or access the restricted content.",---
Security of Digital Files,CloudCart provides a secure environment for storing digital files. The platform encrypts the information about the product and stores it in hidden folders that are not directly accessible from the outside. Merchants can be assured that their digital files are protected from unauthorized downloads.,---
Upselling and Cross-selling with Digital Products,CloudCart also supports upselling and cross-selling options for digital products. Leverage these features to increase sales by offering additional products or services related to the customer's initial purchase. Watch the video tutorial on upselling and cross-selling for more information.,---
Accessing Purchased Digital Products,"Once a customer has purchased a digital product, they can access the content from their account. The customer can log in to their account and navigate to their ""Files"" section to download the purchased file or access the restricted content. Customers can access their purchased digital products at any time, making the process convenient and user-friendly.",---
Best Practices for Selling Digital Products,"When selling digital products, consider the following best practices: 1) Ensure your store setup is optimized for selling digital products, including appropriate cart and checkout settings; 2) Clearly describe the digital product and its features to help customers understand what they are purchasing; 3) Offer upselling and cross-selling opportunities to increase sales; 4) Maintain a secure environment for digital files, ensuring customer trust in your store.",---
Managing Digital Product Inventory and Promotions,"Although tracking inventory for digital products is not always necessary, using the inventory tracking feature can help create a sense of urgency for promotional purposes. For example, you can set a limited number of digital copies available during a promotion, encouraging customers to make a purchase quickly. Keep in mind that you cannot have variations for digital products, so plan your promotions accordingly.",---
Restricted Content Access for Members,"When selling digital products that grant access to restricted content, make sure that only customers who have purchased the content can access it. CloudCart's platform ensures that restricted content is only accessible to customers who have paid for it, providing a seamless experience for both merchants and customers.",---
Customer Download Access,"Once the digital product file and order are complete, customers can download the file directly from their account. They will also receive information about the order, including access to an invoice (if invoicing is enabled) and information about the order status.",---
Disabling Email Templates,"If you prefer not to send certain information to customers, you can go to Marketing > Omnichannel > Email Templates and turn off specific email templates. This way, customers will only receive information relevant to downloading the files.",---
Membership Access and Paid Content,"CloudCart offers membership access for paid content, ideal for online coaches, courses, and presentations. This content can be set up with limited or unlimited access, depending on your preference. To get started, go to Applications and search for the Membership App, which is a paid application. Install the app to enable the selling of digital content online.",---
Creating a Digital Product with Membership Access,"After installing the Membership App, return to the Products section and select a specific product to be digital. This time, the digital product type will be 'Page.' Before proceeding, prepare your pages by going to Marketing > Landing Pages. Create a new page and mark it as 'Private,' so it is accessible only for specific users. The private pages will be available for selection under the product options.",---
Setting Access Duration,"When setting up the digital product, specify the number of days the pages will be accessible for customers after a successful purchase. For example, if you set it to 15 days, customers will have access to the content for that duration.",---
Membership App Email Template,"Upon installing the Membership App, a new email template named ""Send Access to Pages"" will be added. This template informs customers when access to restricted content is granted and includes a link to the specific pages. Be sure to review and customize this email template as needed.",---
Purchasing and Accessing Paid Content,"When a customer purchases a product with restricted access, they will receive an email with access information and links to the pages. Customers can also access the paid content directly from their account by clicking on ""Paid Content."" This option is available as long as their access is active.",---
Subscription Management,"With the Membership App installed, a new menu option named ""Subscriptions"" will be available under the Orders menu. Here, you can view and manage subscriptions for specific customers, including information about the subscription's duration and accessibility, and the pages included in the subscription.",---
Product Listing Page,"The Product Listing Page serves as your central hub for viewing and managing your entire product catalog. From this page, you have access to various tools and features that allow you to efficiently manage your inventory, such as filtering options, search functionality, and bulk actions. Additionally, you can view essential information for each product, such as SKU, price, and stock levels.",---
Advanced Filtering and Searching,"CloudCart offers a range of advanced filtering options that enable you to refine your product list based on multiple criteria. You can apply filters for categories, brands, price range, stock status, and more. Additionally, CloudCart's search functionality allows you to find products quickly by keyword, SKU, product name, description, or barcode. The platform also supports searching for products with specific attributes or custom fields, ensuring that you can locate and manage any item within your inventory with ease.",---
Bulk Actions and Tools,"The Bulk Actions feature in CloudCart allows you to perform actions on multiple products simultaneously, streamlining your product management process. To access this feature, navigate to the Tools menu, which becomes available once you have selected specific products or all products on a page. From here, you can apply various actions to the selected items, such as updating prices, adjusting stock levels, modifying product visibility, and more. You can also create custom bulk actions using CloudCart's API for even greater control over your inventory management.",---
Introduction to Product Statuses,Product statuses in CloudCart are used to manage the availability of products on your online store. There are two default product statuses: In Stock and Out of Stock. These statuses help merchants manage their product inventory and display the availability of products to customers accordingly.,---
Setting Up Default Product Statuses,"To set up default product statuses for your store, create two major statuses: In Stock and Out of Stock. The In Stock status should show the ""Buy"" button for products with a quantity greater than zero, while the Out of Stock status should hide the ""Buy"" button for products with a quantity of zero or less. You can also enable the ""Continue Selling"" option to allow customers to place orders even if the quantity is zero.",---
Adding Custom Product Statuses,"You can add custom product statuses, such as ""Pre-Order,"" to your store. Make sure they don't overlap with your default product statuses. When creating a new custom status, you can leave conditions unspecified, or you can select conditions that don't overlap with other product statuses. Once you've added custom product statuses, you need to map the default In Stock and Out of Stock statuses in the system. This ensures that the platform uses the default statuses for all products, except those that you manually assign a custom status.",---
Manually Assigning Product Statuses,"You can manually assign specific product statuses to individual products. To do this, navigate to the product edit page and select the desired In Stock and Out of Stock statuses for that product. Manually added product statuses have higher priority in the system and will be displayed on the product page. For example, you can assign a ""Pre-Order"" status to a product that doesn't have a quantity yet but will be available at a later stage.",---
Using Actions for Product Management,"Actions in CloudCart provide useful tools for managing your products. These actions include duplicating a product, previewing a product, embedding a product on an external website, and generating a checkout link for a product. To duplicate a product, click the ""Duplicate"" action. To preview a product, click the ""Preview"" action. To embed a product on an external website, select the ""Embed"" action, choose a template, customize the appearance, and generate the code to be embedded. To generate a checkout link, click the ""Checkout Link"" action and copy the link. You can then share this link with customers through chat, email, or messenger applications.",---
Using Checkout Links,"When you share a checkout link with a customer, it adds the specified product to their cart and directs them to the checkout page. If the customer already has items in their cart, the checkout link will add the new product to their existing cart without starting over. Keep in mind that the generated checkout link will only add one quantity of the product to the customer's cart, so they may need to adjust the quantity to meet any minimum order requirements you've set.",---
Additional Actions for Products,"In addition to setting up product statuses and adjusting quantities, CloudCart offers several other actions to help manage your products. These actions include duplicating a product, previewing the product page, embedding a product on an external website, and generating a checkout link for direct purchase. Duplicating a product creates a copy of the original product, excluding its images. Previewing the product page allows you to see how the product will appear on your website. Embedding a product on an external website involves generating a code that can be copied and pasted into another site, where the product and its add-to-cart functionality will be displayed. The checkout link feature generates a direct link to add the product to a customer's cart, which can be shared via chat, email, or other messaging applications. This allows for a quicker purchasing process, as customers can directly add the product to their cart and proceed to checkout.",---
Utilizing the Short Number Field,"The short number field allows you to assign a specific position to a product in the product listing. By entering a numerical value in this field, you can dictate the order in which products appear when customers browse through a product category containing multiple items. This feature enables you to strategically place products, enhancing visibility and potentially driving sales.",---
Adjusting Sort Settings,"To ensure your product listing adheres to the specified short number order, you must modify the sort settings within the store. This step is crucial, as it allows the platform to recognize and display the products according to their assigned positions.",---
Hidden Products and Visibility,"If a product is not visible in the product category page, it may be marked as hidden. Hidden products will not appear in the listing, so to make them visible, you must change the product's visibility settings.",---
Short Number Field: Zero Considerations,"When using the short number field, it's important to understand that the value '0' is treated differently. The platform interprets '0' as a larger number than any other value entered, so avoid using it as a sorting order. Instead, utilize numbers ranging from 1 to 2,000 or more, ensuring your products are displayed in the desired order.",---
Adding a New Product,"To add a new product to your CloudCart store, navigate to the product management interface, and click on the ""Add New Product"" button. This will open a form where you can enter all the necessary information about the product, such as its name, price, and inventory status.",---
Brand and Vendor Selection,"For each product, you can specify the brand and vendor. This information will allow customers to filter the catalog by the manufacturer or maker of a product. You can either select a vendor from a pre-existing list or create a new vendor by typing in their name.",---
Tags,"You can add tags to your products and choose from pre-defined tags or create new ones. Tags can be used to create relationships between products, such as pairing socks with shoes. This feature can be used to display related products at the bottom of a product detail page, based on similar tags. Tags can also be used for upselling by displaying products that complement each other, such as a TV stand for a 32-inch television.",---
Product Dimensions and Shipping Information,"When entering product details, you can input the dimensions of the product. These dimensions are used for calculating shipping costs with courier services and will not be displayed on the storefront. It is important to note that these dimensions are for shipping purposes only and should not be expected to appear on the product page for customers to view or filter.",---
SEO Configuration,"In the product editor, you can configure the SEO title and description for each product. These settings help improve the visibility of your products on search engines. If you enter a description for your product, an SEO meta description will be generated automatically. You can edit this information to create a more tailored and optimized description for search engines. It is crucial to have an SEO-optimized product page to ensure better visibility on search engines and increase the chances of attracting potential customers.",---
Image and Multimedia Manager,"CloudCart's multimedia manager allows you to upload images, 360-degree images, and videos directly from YouTube to showcase your products. The platform will automatically compress and optimize images for fast loading and better performance. You can add up to 36 images for a 360-degree view of a product, creating an interactive experience for customers. You can also drag and drop images from your local storage for easy uploading. The multimedia manager supports managing multiple images, deleting them, and even setting a YouTube video as the main media for a product.",---
Publishing a Product,"Once you have entered all the necessary product information, you can publish the product online. You have the option to schedule the product's publication for a later date or set an expiration date for the product to be automatically unpublished. After publishing the product, you can use the shortcut provided in the product editor to view the product detail page on your storefront.",---
Short Description Field,"In the product editor, you can add a short description for each product by clicking the ""Short Description"" button. This field is not mandatory but can be used to provide a brief overview of the product or highlight specific features. This field supports HTML code, allowing you to add images, icons, or other visual elements to enhance the product presentation. It is important to create a visually appealing and informative product page to engage customers and encourage them to make a purchase.",---
360-Degree Images,"Adding 360-degree images to a product can provide a more immersive and interactive experience for customers, giving them the impression of viewing a 3D model of the product. To create a 360-degree image, users can upload up to 36 different perspective images. In the storefront, customers can manipulate and rotate the final image for a smoother viewing experience.",---
Introduction to Product Configuration,"When configuring a product in CloudCart, it's essential to understand the various settings and attributes involved. These settings help manage inventory, track sales, and provide customers with accurate information about the products they're purchasing.",---
Choosing Product Type,"First, determine if the product you're configuring is a physical or digital product. Physical products require shipping and handling, while digital products involve uploading a file that customers will receive upon purchase. Physical products are more commonly sold on CloudCart, but digital products offer an easy alternative for certain sellers.",---
Configuring Shipping Settings,"For physical products, enable the Require Shipping setting. This allows you to input the product's weight, which is crucial for calculating shipping costs with courier services. Accurate weight information helps customers understand the total cost of their purchase, including shipping fees.",---
Inventory Management,"Enable the Track Inventory setting to monitor the quantity of products you have in stock. When inputting quantities that include decimals, remember to use a point (.) instead of a comma (,) to avoid confusion. This setting ensures that your inventory numbers are accurate and up-to-date.",---
Continuous Selling Option,Enable the Continuous Selling setting if your product can be restocked or produced on-demand. This setting allows customers to continue purchasing the product even when the inventory reaches zero. It's especially helpful for sellers who create their own products or can easily restock items.,---
Low Stock Notifications,"To receive notifications when a product's inventory is running low, set a Low Quantity Threshold. When the product's quantity reaches the specified number, you'll receive a notification alerting you that the product is almost out of stock. This helps you stay informed about your inventory levels and plan for restocking.",---
Minimum Purchase Quantity,"Set a Minimum Quantity if you want to require customers to purchase a certain amount of a product. Customers can add smaller quantities to their cart, but they won't be able to complete the checkout process until they meet the minimum quantity requirement. This feature helps increase average order value and may be useful for bulk sales or promotional offers.",---
Product Identifiers: SKU and Barcode,"Choose an identifier for your product, either an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) or a barcode. SKUs are typically used for tracking inventory with warehouse software, while barcodes are often provided by the product's manufacturer. Both identifiers help manage inventory and track product sales.",---
Understanding Product Statuses,"Product statuses help you manage inventory and sales by providing vital information about product availability. Familiarize yourself with these statuses to ensure that your product listings are accurate and up-to-date, ultimately improving the customer experience on your CloudCart store.",---
Basic Features,"Today, I'm going to review with you several basic features integrated into the Multilingual application. You can expect functionalities such as creating a brand new language version which actually creates a brand new store, copying the design, copying the navigation, copying pages created with the page builder, copying blog posts and categories, and copying the entire product catalog.",---
Advanced AI Translation,"On top of these features, our merchants will be able to translate every single bit of text from the main store to the target language of the language version with advanced AI technology, thanks to our partners from Google. The translation quality is really good, especially for basic information such as colors or short descriptions.",---
Store Settings and Translations,"Make sure that your content is equal to your store settings in order to expect great results. We charge our merchants per processed character. If the character is not translatable, it doesn't mean that it is not processed. Every single character that is processed will be charged.",---
Accessing the Multilingual App,You can find the application from the App Store. Install the Multilingual App and follow the configuration steps to create a new language version.,---
Creating a New Language Version,"From the app, add a language version related to your main business. This language version will copy the information from the main store. Select your desired target language and follow the steps to complete the configuration.",---
Copying and Translating Elements,"In the app, enable copying and translation for various elements such as design, menu, blocks, and pages. Note that design cannot be translated and pages built with the page builder will not be translated.",---
Translating Product Catalog,"Select which elements of the product catalog you want to be translated, such as product names, descriptions, categories, and image alternative texts.",---
Adjusting Prices for Language Version,"When copying prices from the main store to the language version store, you have the option to multiply the prices by a specific factor or set the decimals to a specific value for marketing purposes.",---
Choosing a Subscription Plan,"Choosing a subscription plan from here gives our merchants an additional discount on the pricing because they are creating an additional subscription for a language version. This is a huge benefit, as they get an additional discount for creating their additional language version.",---
CloudCart Synchronizer,"We highly recommend using CloudCart Synchronizer, which is a huge advantage. This application synchronizes product quantities from the main store to the language version store. If merchants prefer two-way communication for the synchronization of quantities, they must purchase CloudCart Synchronizer additionally for the language version store to push data to the main store.",---
Confirmation Page and Tracking Progress,"On the confirmation page, you can see your plan, copying information, and fees for copying and AI translation. Once you pay, you will be redirected to the tracking progress page, where you can see the progress of the application. The translation process depends on the volume of characters and sentences that need to be translated. If there are millions of characters, the translation process could take hours.",---
Storefront Language Settings,"The flags displayed on your store represent the storefront language. No matter what the language version of the channel is, the flags are a representation of the storefront language. When you click on a flag, you will be redirected to the general settings of the corresponding language store.",---
Additional Settings,"In the additional settings, you can find options for copying newly added products from your main store to the language version, translating them, and copying pricing information. You can also set the price rounding and choose an approval method for the newly added products (manual or automatic). There is also an option for automatic deletion of products deleted from the main store, which helps keep your product catalogs tidy across different languages. Pay attention that additional services must be purchased for these settings to work. If you don't have enough funds or tokens for these services, you won't be able to take advantage of these options.",---
Language Switcher,"Enabling the language switcher option will display a switcher on your store's homepage, allowing customers to switch between different languages. The switcher can be configured from the additional settings.",---
CloudCart's Marketing Focus,"CloudCart is one of the most advanced e-commerce platforms on the market, enabling our customers to use marketing tools to drive more traffic and engage with more customers. Our company's core philosophy is to help our merchants drive more sales, get more traffic, and convert more users into customers. Because of this, we focus our efforts on building more marketing tools.",---
Marketing Tools Available,"At CloudCart, you can find more marketing tools than any other marketing platform that is e-commerce oriented, and vice versa. In other words, we have tons of features for marketing. We offer more than 10 types of discounts with over 100 options to create different discounts at scale without needing to do it manually. Our platform includes up-sales, cross-sales, down-sales, landing pages, sales funnels, and campaigns that enable you to contact your customers at scale through an automated process. Additionally, we have trigger-based emails with contextual content that will be delivered to every single customer who takes any action at your store. We also offer bundles and many other marketing tools to help you succeed.",---
Importance of SEO,"Search engine optimization is vital for our customers because most websites receive 60-70% of their traffic through search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Baidu, etc. By using CloudCart's search engine friendly tools and features, you can achieve more organic search traffic, also known as ""free traffic.""",---
Controlling Robots,"One of the primary purposes of SEO is to control the robots (like Googlebot) that crawl your website. There are two main aspects to this: controlling the robots and managing the content on your website. With CloudCart, you can easily manage the robots through the robots.txt file and the sitemap.xml file.",---
Robots.txt,The robots.txt file lives on each website and tells robots which pages they can visit and which they cannot. This file is essential for SEO because it helps prevent search engines from indexing low-quality or irrelevant pages on your website. CloudCart has a built-in robots.txt file that you can control through the marketing settings of the platform.,---
Sitemap.xml,"The sitemap.xml file works alongside the robots.txt file to show search engines which pages they should visit. By creating a sitemap.xml file, you can ensure that search engines only index the most important pages on your website, such as product pages, categories, and contact pages. CloudCart has a built-in sitemap.xml file that you can control through the marketing settings of the platform.",---
Canonical Tag,"The canonical tag is another essential tool for controlling the robots and avoiding duplicate content on your website. This tag tells search engines that a specific page is a copy or child page of another, more important page. This helps to prevent search engines from indexing multiple versions of the same page, which can lead to lower rankings. CloudCart has built-in canonical tags for product and category pages.",---
Using CloudCart's SEO Tools Responsibly,"It's important to note that CloudCart's SEO tools are powerful and should be used with caution. If you are not familiar with SEO best practices, it's a good idea to consult with a professional before making any significant changes to your website's settings. Misusing these tools can lead to your website being penalized or even banned by search engines.",---
Conclusion,"In conclusion, CloudCart offers a range of built-in SEO tools that can help you optimize your e-commerce website for search engines, leading to increased organic search traffic and improved visibility for your products and categories. By controlling the robots and managing the content on your website, you can ensure that your site ranks highly in search engine results, attracting more potential customers and ultimately driving more sales.",---
Understanding Filters and Dynamically Generated Pages,"Filters and dynamically generated pages often generate a lot of URLs that need to be crawled by search engine crawlers. To avoid being spammy to Google, it's crucial to restrict crawlers from accessing all of these pages. One way to do this is by adding ""no index, no follow"" tags to the HTML pages. This will prevent the pages from being indexed or crawled by search engine robots.",---
Controlling Indexing of Filtered and Sorted Pages,"To control the indexing of filtered and sorted pages, navigate to Marketing > Main SEO > Index Filtered and Sort Pages. Here, you can specify the number of parameters you want to be indexed by search engine crawlers. The default settings are optimized for best results, but you can play around with the numbers if you know what you're doing. Remember, changing these settings without proper knowledge can negatively impact your website's search engine ranking.",---
301 Redirects and Controlling Robots,"The 301 redirect feature is essential when you want to delete a product or change a URL without losing search engine ranking. A 301 redirect tells search engine crawlers that the old URL has permanently moved to a new address. To set up a 301 redirect, go to the SEO section and click on ""Add Redirect."" You can choose a specific product or manually input the new URL. This feature is also helpful when migrating customers from old systems to CloudCart by importing redirects from a file.",---
Importance of 301 Redirects,"Using 301 redirects correctly can significantly impact your website's search engine ranking. They help maintain your ""crawler budget"" and ensure that search engine crawlers access the most relevant pages on your website. By implementing 301 redirects, you can seamlessly migrate customers from old systems to CloudCart without losing search engine ranking and maintaining the effectiveness of any existing online advertisements.",---
Croll Budget and Dessert Pages,"To help Google avoid spending too much time on unnecessary pages, we provide them with only the best content, referred to as the ""dessert"" pages. This is achieved by using various tools enabled by default in CloudCart.",---
Server Side Rendering,"Server side rendering is a complex, top-notch functionality found on CloudCart. It provides better visibility for search engines and a stable infrastructure to crawl without disturbing the user experience. Each CloudCart store has a separate environment for crawlers and humans, ensuring that customers can browse the website with ease, while crawlers can access the server-rendered copy of the website. This technique saves merchants time, energy, and server power, leading to a better browsing experience for real users.",---
Structured Data and Rich Snippets,"CloudCart utilizes structured data, also known as rich snippets, to make the website content more understandable to bots. This technology allows the presentation of information like product names, descriptions, URLs, brand names, offers, and more in a bot-readable format. CloudCart uses JSON-LD, which is Google's preferred format for structured data. This helps enhance search engine results with additional information like pricing and stock status.",---
Meta Information,"Meta information, which has been around for over 20 years, is used to provide information to robots that is not necessarily visible to human users. CloudCart allows users to edit meta information for products and pages. For products, the meta information can be edited under the SEO configuration section, while for pages, it can be found on the right-hand side of the page builder. If using a generic homepage, meta titles and descriptions can be specified under the marketing SEO section. This is where you can also edit meta information for the contact page, product section, product vendors, and blog section. Meta information helps search engines like Google understand and display the content of your website more effectively.",---
SEO Spinner,"We have built something which is called an SEO spinner. This is something which is not available, it's not available even to you guys internally into the company.

The system will invalidate the information. If you re-enter the correct VAT number, the system will validate it using the VIES service.",---

If customers pay the shipping cost directly to the delivery provider, taxes should be calculated before the shipping cost.",---
EU VAT Regulations,"When selling within the European Union (EU), CloudCart has integrated all EU countries, simplifying the tax configuration process. When selling goods in your home country, apply the local VAT rate to all customers.

The tax module is built to handle these scenarios automatically, ensuring compliance with EU VAT regulations.",---
Texts for VAT Application,"The texts for VAT application are left empty as they differ for different countries within the EU and for customers outside the EU. The VAT rates can be different depending on the country, region, or product category.",---
Different Taxes for Different Categories,"Some countries have different tax rates for different product categories. For example, bread might have a 0% VAT, while children's goods may have a lower VAT rate than the standard rate. This allows merchants to apply different VAT rates for specific product categories.",---
VAT Overrides by Category and Region,"CloudCart allows you to create VAT overrides based on product category and region. For example, you can set a lower VAT rate for children's goods in a specific region or city. This way, only customers in that particular location will receive the discounted VAT rate.",---
VAT Application in Multiple Countries,"If you operate in multiple countries, the platform will determine the customer's location and apply the appropriate VAT rate accordingly. This includes different rules for applying VAT to customers and companies, as well as applying VAT before or after shipping costs.",---
VAT Overrides by Region,"If you want to apply different VAT rates to specific regions without defining a product category, you can do so using VAT overrides by region. This allows you to apply different tax rates for customers in certain locations.",---
VAT for Companies and End Customers,"VAT rules may differ for companies and end customers. For example, a Bulgarian company might charge VAT to end customers but not to other companies. CloudCart ensures that VAT is applied accurately and keeps the platform compliant with relevant authorities.",---
Adding VAT Numbers,"If a company adds their VAT number and it is validated by the platform, the VAT will be removed from their order. If the VAT number is not present or not validated, the system will not remove the VAT. This ensures accuracy and compliance with regulations.",---
Fees,"Fees work similarly to taxes, but they can be added as a percentage or a flat fee. Fees can be added for various reasons, such as packaging, delivery, or handling. To add fees, go to taxes and then add fees.",---
Benefits of CloudCart Features,"In the past, online store owners had to manage all the necessary information regarding shipping their packages by hand. But today, CloudCart offers many integrated features, such as real-time shipping cost estimations and real-time payment.",---
Pre-built Shipping Methods,"Every CloudCart store comes with pre-built shipping methods based on price, weight, and a combination of price and weight. Shipping methods can also be assigned to specific regions, payment providers, and product categories.",---
Carrier Integrations Overview,"CloudCart is constantly working on integrating different shipping providers. Currently, there are around seven or eight fully integrated shipping providers. These integrations include real-time shipping cost estimation, waybill generation, email notifications, and more.",---
DHL Integration,"To integrate DHL, go to applications and search for DHL. Enter your credentials and customize the provider's name, logo, and other settings. The integration supports various service types and allows you to create waybills, send tracking information, and more.",---
Other Carrier Integrations,"CloudCart also integrates with various country-specific carriers such as Speedy, Econt, Fan Courier, Cargus, ACS, and DPD. These integrations offer similar features to the DHL integration. Check the help center for more information about each integration.",---
Order Fulfillment and Email Templates,"When fulfilling orders, you can generate waybills and send tracking information to customers using email templates. The templates include order status updates, delivery dates, and tracking codes.",---
Creating and Managing Waybills,"When working with orders, you can fulfill products with the click of a button, which will provide a live shipping cost estimation. You can change various details and generate waybills, which can be printed directly from the store.",---
Quick Order Explanation,The quick order option is not an actual order but rather a way for customers to express their interest in a specific product. This feature only works for individual products and cannot be used to purchase multiple products at once.,---
Enabling Quick Order,"To enable the quick order feature, go to Apps > All Apps and search for the card icon with a timer. Install the application to your store, and you will see additional configuration options.",---
Advanced Features,"The quick order app uses innovative technology to gather information from a customer's IP address. This can help determine their country and possibly their city without asking for that information. You can also require a phone number, first and last name, and email address from the customer.",---
Tracking and Events,"You can define your own personal events for the quick order, such as when a customer clicks the button but doesn't finalize the order. You can also track separate events for regular checkout and quick order options.",---
Text and Styling,"Customize the text that appears on the fast order page and after the customer clicks the ""Purchase"" or ""Make Order"" button. You can also play with styling options and colors for the quick order button.",---
Order Submission,"When a customer submits a quick order, they will need to provide their email address, phone number, and accept terms and marketing policies. This information goes directly to the merchant's administrative area.",---
Order Processing,"In the Orders menu, a quick order is indicated by a small couch or chronometer icon. Quick orders don't have complete addresses, so you will need to contact the customer for their address before preparing the order for shipment.",---
Fulfilling Quick Orders,"After obtaining and validating the customer's address, you can select a shipping provider and fulfill the product. Information can then be sent to the customer for tracking purposes.",---
Payment Options,"Quick orders primarily work for offline payments like cash on delivery or bank wire transfers. For online payments, you will need to send the customer a link to finalize the order.",---
Disadvantages,"Quick orders can increase merchants' workload since they must manually handle shipping and billing addresses, payment preferences, and more. While it allows merchants to accept requests faster, it also increases manual work.",---
The Checkout Process,We invested significant time in providing a seamless checkout experience that includes monitoring and analyzing thousands of orders and customer behavior to create a comprehensive solution for the checkout and cart settings. We constantly add new features and functionalities to make the process more adaptable and flexible for customers.,---
Abandoned Cart Reminder,"The abandoned cart reminder is an advanced feature that is a competitive advantage for CloudCart. It reminds customers about items in their checkout process but not completed as an order. Enabling this feature will send transactional emails to remind customers about their abandoned carts. You can choose which type of reminder to send (email, messenger, or both). The timing of the reminder is crucial and can be set between 30 and 180 minutes.",---
Shipping Address for Digital Products,"In rare cases, you may want to ask for a shipping address for digital products to be covered by seller protection. This can help prevent disputes, refund requests, and chargebacks, as you'll have evidence of delivering the order.",---
Automatically Select Shipping Option,"If there is only one shipping option, this setting will automatically select it, reducing the number of steps in the checkout process.",---
Minimum Order Amount,"Setting a minimum order amount can help increase your average order value (AOV). Calculate your current AOV and increase it by 15% to determine the minimum order value. Keep in mind that this setting should have a relation between the pricing of your product catalog. The minimum order amount is an intrusive way to increase AOV, so ensure it is not set too high.",---
Maximum Product Quantity,"This feature allows you to set a maximum count of one product that can be added to the cart. For example, you can limit your customers to purchase no more than three pieces of a specific product.",---
Maximum Cart Quantity per Customer,"This feature sets a maximum number of products in general, not per product, that can be added to the cart. For example, if you set a limit of one product, customers will not be allowed to purchase more than one product. This feature may not be popular because it restricts sales, but can be useful when you have a limited number of products or want to implement specific marketing strategies.",---
Email Notifications for Low Product Quantities,"This setting allows you to receive email notifications when the total quantity of a product decreases to a certain threshold. By enabling this feature, there is no need to set up individual product thresholds for sending notification emails.",---
Order Status and Product Quantity Decrease,"It is crucial to understand how setting up the right configuration for order status (pending, paid, or fulfilled) will impact product quantity decrease and other processes like sending email notifications to customers for order processing. Your choice of payment methods (online or offline) can also affect how product quantities are decreased based on order status. Make sure to stick with your current settings and avoid changing them if you have open orders.",---
Default Shipping Type,"You can choose a default shipping type (e.g., pick up from store or shipping address) that will be automatically selected and opened for your customers during the checkout process. This can help guide customers and make the process smoother.",---
Default Shipping Provider,"If you have multiple shipping providers, you can select a default shipping provider that will be automatically selected during the checkout process. This can also help make the process faster and smoother for your customers.",---
Default Payment Provider,"You can choose a default payment provider that will be automatically selected during the checkout process, making it faster and smoother for your customers.",---
Unique Order Number,"Instead of using a system ID, it is advisable to use a string of numbers and letters as a unique order number. This can prevent competitors from tracking your progress and order numbers, and it also ensures a unique identifier for each order without any gaps.",---
Payment Microservice Architecture,"We built payments as a microservice, which means there is a separate payment gateway, a different database, different codes, and different servers that accept requests from third-party providers like payment providers. This independency allows us to scale the platform and guarantee our merchants a 100% working process and environment. Thanks to this microservice architecture, we can accept currently more than 1,500 transactions per minute.",---
CloudCart's Transaction Volume,"To date, CloudCart processes around 45-100 transactions per minute. In the past year, we have processed more than three million transactions, which represent around €250 million in transactions.",---
Payment Provider Integration Framework,"We have developed an innovative framework that enables our developers to integrate new payment solutions in no more than 24-48 hours. If you have a customer that is interested in integrating CloudCart with a payment solution that is not yet presented, the cost of the integration will be split between CloudCart and the customer, with each party covering 50% of the estimated cost.",---
Current Payment Providers,"To see the payment providers currently integrated into CloudCart, go to Settings and Payments. Some major providers include PayPal, Braintree, Mollie, Stripe, Paymypols, Keepa Touch, Feed Bank, Borica, Paysafe, Raiffeisen Bank, Connectix, MobilePay, EveryPay, and SeePay. We also offer cash on delivery, pay at store, vouchers, and bank wire options.",---
Invoicing Basics,"Invoicing in CloudCart allows you to set up and automate invoicing for your e-commerce store. Invoices are sent to customers automatically via email as attachments. Additionally, the invoicing module also includes credit notes, which are useful when refunding money to customers who return goods.",---
Invoice Formats,"Invoices in CloudCart can be output in two formats: PDF and CSV (comma-separated values). The PDF format is sent to customers via email, while the CSV format can be downloaded from the invoicing section of the orders menu. The PDF format is used to send invoice documents to customers, while the CSV format is useful for sending order and payment information to your accounting team.",---
Invoice Settings,"To access the invoicing settings, go to the settings menu and find the invoicing option. From there, you can activate the invoicing feature, set up invoice issuing conditions, and configure the invoice number padding, prefix, and suffix. Customize your invoice numbers to meet the requirements of your government or tax authority.",---
Business Credentials and Credit Notes,"In the invoicing settings, you can also enter your business credentials, such as your business name, VAT registration number, and contact information. For credit notes, set up the invoice number padding and select the payment method used for refunds. It's important to stick with the actual payment method used for making the order and payment.",---
Customizing Invoices and Packing Slips,"CloudCart allows you to add a watermark text to your invoices and customize the design of your invoices, packing slips, and credit notes using provided variables. Download the template, make your desired changes, and paste the modified code back into the platform. This allows you to create a unique brand identity for your invoices and packing slips. If you wish to revert to the default template, simply delete the custom code.",---
Invoicing Automation,"The invoicing module in CloudCart automates the invoicing process for each order, saving you time in managing orders and invoices. Invoices are sent to customers via email, and you can easily download the CSV file with invoices to send to your accountant. This automation is essential for any e-commerce business.",---
Geo Zones and Google Maps,"Geo zones in CloudCart are based on Google Maps technology. Although it is possible to use geo zones without Google Maps, integrating Google Maps into your store will provide a more comprehensive feature set. To integrate Google Maps, follow the instructions in our help center article. Without Google Maps integration, geo zones will only provide country-level detail.",---
Creating a Geo Zone,"To create a geo zone, first determine your store's needs and the area it serves. Geo zones are based on customer geo coordinates. Add a new geo zone and name it accordingly. Once created, you can configure the zone with different operators, such as ""includes"" or ""includes only,"" to specify which countries, cities, or neighborhoods are included in the zone. This will help prepare your store to interact with customers from the specified locations.",---
Understanding Operators,"When configuring a geo zone, it is important to understand the difference between ""includes"" and ""includes only"" operators. ""Includes"" means that the zone includes everything from the selected area, while ""includes only"" means that the zone works exclusively for the specific record defined. There are also other operators like ""includes all locations except"" which allows you to exclude specific locations from the geo zone.",---
Configuring Geo Zones,"After setting up your geo zones, you can configure them to include or exclude specific countries, cities, or neighborhoods. For example, if you want to create a geo zone for the European Union, you would need to add each EU country individually. Once your geo zones are configured, they will help determine pricing, discounts, and shipping costs for customers based on their location.",---
Using Geo Zones for Taxes and Shipping,"Geo zones can be used to apply different taxes and shipping rates to customers based on their location. For example, you can create a tax rate that is only applicable to customers in Bulgaria or a shipping rate that only applies to customers within the European Union. This allows you to customize your store's pricing and shipping options based on the specific needs and regulations of the regions your store serves.",---
Setting up Special Discounts,"To create a special discount, navigate to the ""Discount"" section. Only discounts applied at checkout can have customer region restrictions. By defining a GEO zone, you can specify which customers from certain regions are eligible for the discount.",---
Checkout Discounts,"At checkout, you can offer various types of discounts, such as promo codes, countdown discount timers, and container discounts. These can be tailored to specific GEO zones, meaning that only customers from certain regions will be eligible for the discount. To create a discount for a specific GEO zone, select the region from the available options.",---
Localization and Working Hours,"By using GEO zones, you can estimate delivery times for specific regions and customers. For example, you can integrate with applications like Working Hours to provide accurate delivery estimates based on customer location. If you need more information on this, refer to the help center.",---
GEO Zones and Platform Adaptation,"When you use GEO zones, your platform will adapt to the customer's address, adjusting pricing, discounts, and shipping costs accordingly. This allows you to create a personalized shopping experience for different groups of customers based on their location.",---
Creating and Managing GEO Zones,"You can create an unlimited number of GEO zones and define unlimited local entities for each GEO zone. However, it's important to note that sometimes Google Maps data may not be complete or consistent due to various factors, such as local authorities not providing sufficient data. To address this issue, you can use the geo polygon feature.",---
Geo Polygon Feature,"The geo polygon feature allows you to define specific blocks on Google Maps by inputting coordinates. This can be particularly useful if you want to focus on a specific street or region. To create a geo polygon, search for your desired location, click on the map to draw the polygon, and then assign a name for easy identification. You can then assign the geo polygon to a GEO zone in the ""GEO Zones"" section. This feature provides total control over your store's localization, allowing you to cater to specific areas or even individual houses, as well as the entire world.",---
Shipping Methods and Geo Zones,"By assigning a geo polygon to a GEO zone, you can restrict shipping methods to specific locations. For example, a shipping method could be visible only for addresses within the defined geo polygon. This level of control extends to discounts, pricing, and shipping costs, enabling you to create a highly personalized shopping experience based on customer location.",---
Applying Discounts Based on GEO Zones,"To apply special discounts based on customer location, you can create discounts that are only applicable at checkout. These discounts will have the ability to define the customer region and can be applied to specific GEO zones, such as specific countries or regions. Examples of checkout discounts include promo codes and countdown discount timers.",---
Creating a Discount for a Specific GEO Zone,"To create a discount for a specific GEO zone, start by defining the zone in the admin panel. For example, you can create a discount that is applicable only for customers in Bulgaria or the EU. This allows you to offer different discounts to customers based on their location.",---
Estimating Delivery Time Based on GEO Zones,"You can estimate delivery time for specific regions and customers using the ""working hours"" functionality in CloudCart. This feature is useful for calculating delivery times based on the customer's location. If you do not have this functionality enabled, you can find more information in the help center.",---
How GEO Zones Work at Checkout,"When a customer goes to checkout, the platform adapts the pricing, discounts, and shipping costs based on their location. For example, if a customer from Bulgaria is eligible for a discount and shipping method specific to their GEO zone, these options will be displayed at checkout. If the customer's address changes to a different country, the discount and shipping options may be removed or updated accordingly.",---
Creating and Using Geo Polygons,"Geo polygons allow you to define specific areas on Google Maps by inputting coordinates. This feature is useful when the data from Google Maps is incomplete or inconsistent. By creating a geo polygon, you can specify a particular street or area where you want to offer discounts, shipping options, or different pricing. To use a geo polygon, simply draw the area on the map, assign it to a GEO zone, and apply it to the relevant features such as discounts, shipping, or pricing.",---
Mixing and Matching GEO Zones and Geo Polygons,"You can mix and match GEO zones and geo polygons in your store's settings. For example, you can include a specific country and a geo polygon within that country, or you can use a geo polygon exclusively. This allows for greater customization of your store's features and offerings based on customer location.",---
Controlling Localization with Google Maps Integration,"Integrating with Google Maps, Google Places, geo polygons, and geo zones gives you complete control over your store's localization. You can work with specific areas or houses, or you can work with the entire world, offering various discounts, shipping options, and pricing based on customer location. This level of control is a key advantage of CloudCart's localization features.",---
Summary,"Geo zones and geo polygons in CloudCart allow you to define specific settings for your store based on customer location. By integrating Google Maps and creating tailored geo zones, you can offer customized pricing, tax rates, and shipping options for customers in different regions. This guide has provided an overview of how to create and configure geo zones, as well as how to apply them to various aspects of your store. Use this knowledge to enhance your store's localization features.",---
The Power of the Checkout Process,The checkout process in CloudCart is powerful and fast due to the integration of various geolocation services. We will reveal some features under the hood that make the checkout process efficient and user-friendly.,---
Geolocation Service Integrations,"CloudCart integrates with several geolocation services such as Google Maps, MaxMind IP geolocation database, GeoNames organization, and Google Places. This integration allows the platform to accurately locate customers and populate their information into the data fields.",---
Improved Conversion Rates,"The integration of geolocation services, such as Google Maps, has increased the conversion rate on average by 0.7%. This is a significant increase as it requires minimal effort from the customer during the checkout process.",---
Automatic Field Population,CloudCart's geolocation functionality allows customers to populate their address fields automatically based on their location with a single click. This streamlines the checkout process and makes it faster and more efficient.,---
Address Detection and Validation,The platform can detect and validate addresses and businesses by name. This information is automatically pulled from Google Maps and entered into the appropriate fields during the checkout process.,---
Phone Number Validation and Formatting,"CloudCart's system validates phone numbers and automatically reformats them into a consistent format. This is important for maintaining consistent data structures for campaigns, customer communication, and third-party application integration.",---
Shipping Cost Calculation and Validation,The geolocation information allows CloudCart to provide precise shipping cost calculations and address validation. This eliminates the need to verify addresses manually and ensures that the information is accurate and reliable.,---
Discounts and Product Availability Based on Geolocation,"Based on geolocation information, merchants can offer discounts and display different product availabilities to customers from specific countries or regions. This allows for a more personalized shopping experience for users.",---
Geolocation Redirect Functionality,CloudCart's geolocation redirect functionality enables merchants to redirect customers to specific stores based on their location. This is useful for merchants operating in different countries with separate store domains.,---
Conclusion,"In summary, CloudCart's geolocation functionality provides merchants with improved conversion rates, streamlined checkout processes, personalized promotions and discounts, and better data consistency. This innovative technology combines various services to deliver powerful features for merchants.",---
Verifying Customer Accounts,"CloudCart checkout offers two options for verifying customer accounts: don't verify email addresses and verify email addresses. We generally don't advise merchants to verify their customers' emails, but in some cases, this functionality might be necessary. If the ""verify email addresses"" setting is enabled, users won't be able to complete the checkout until they verify their email address. However, this can make the checkout process less smooth, so use this feature only if it's crucial for your business.",---
Configuring Customer Profiles,"CloudCart allows you to configure the type of customer profiles you accept at your store. By default, it is set to guests and members, but you can change it to members only if needed. Requiring members only is a good option for selling digital products, as guest checkout is not allowed in this case. Based on the product type at the checkout, the platform will decide which type of profile to ask from the customer. For digital products or a mixture of digital and physical products, the platform will require customers to register at the store. If only physical products are in the cart, the platform will allow customers to check out as a guest. It's generally recommended to stick with the default setting (guests and members) unless your business is focused on digital inventory.",---
Guests and Members Functionality,"When the setting is configured to guests and members, the checkout process will be faster for customers with only physical products in their cart, as they only need to add their shipping address. If the customer has a digital product or a mixture of digital and physical products in their cart, the checkout process will require them to register. This functionality creates a consistent and adaptable checkout process based on the products in the cart.",---
Guests Only Functionality,"When the setting is configured to guests only, customers can only check out as a guest, and the login option is removed. However, it is not recommended to set up guest-only checkout, as it may give the impression that the customer is not planning to make future purchases from the store. Instead, it's better to use the default setting of guests and members, allowing customers the option to register or check out as a guest.",---
Converting Guests into Members,"We have a brilliant functionality that converts your guest users into members. When a new customer places an order and provides their name, email address, and phone number, the system automatically creates an account for them using their email as the username and generating a random password. The customer receives a welcome email with their new account information. The next time they visit the store, they can log in using their email and password, which enables a faster and smoother checkout process.",---
Importance of Informing Customers,"If customers are unaware that an account has been created for them, they may get confused and think the platform isn't working properly. To avoid this, it's a good idea to inform customers about their new account on the thank you page or create a custom thank you page with the information.",---
Benefits of Converting Guests into Members,"Converting guests into members allows customers to check out faster by reusing their stored information, such as addresses, from previous orders. This minimizes the steps and fields required during the checkout process, making it easier and more efficient for customers.",---
Hiding Prices for Guests,"There is an option to hide product prices for guest users, which is useful for B2B businesses that want to protect their pricing from casual viewers. When this option is enabled, only logged-in users can see the product prices.",---
Requiring Shipping and Billing Addresses on Registration,"For B2B businesses, it's possible to require customers to provide their shipping and billing addresses during the registration process. This ensures that all necessary information is collected upfront and can be used for order processing and account management.",---
Customization Options,"The platform offers a variety of settings and options for configuring customer accounts and checkout processes to align with your specific business needs. This includes the ability to enable or disable guest checkout, require address information on registration, and more. Continuously explore and customize these settings to optimize your customer experience.",---
Creating an Order: Steps,"To create an order: 1. Click on the ""Create an Order"" button. 2. Select an existing customer or create a new one. 3. Choose the delivery method (based on your store's settings). 4. Input the shipping address from the customer's assigned addresses. 5. Select a product and add the desired quantity. 6. Override the price if necessary. 7. Choose a payment method (offline or online). 8. Select a shipping carrier. 9. Click ""Create Order"" or ""Create Order and Send Email to the Customer.""",---
Offline vs. Online Payment Methods,"There are two main payment method options: offline and online. Offline payment methods include cash on delivery, pay in store, or bank wire transfer. These methods allow you to finalize the entire order without customer intervention. Online payment methods, such as credit/debit card or mobile wallet, require the customer to finalize the order. The customer must confirm the order, select a shipping method, and pay using their chosen online payment method.",---
Creating an Order with Online Payment,"To create an order with an online payment method: 1. Select an online payment provider, such as Braintree, during the order creation process. 2. Click ""Create Order and Send Email to the Customer."" 3. The customer will receive an email with a link to view and confirm the order. 4. The customer must accept the store's policies before confirming the order. 5. Once the customer confirms the order and completes the payment, the order status will change to ""Paid.""",---
Customizing the Order Confirmation Email,"To edit the order confirmation email template, navigate to ""Marketing"" > ""Omnichannel"" > ""Email Templates"" and scroll down to the ""Order Confirmation Email Template."" Customize the template to suit your store's needs.",---
GDPR Compliance,"When creating an order through the admin panel, it is important to ensure GDPR compliance. The best way to achieve this is by sending a link to the customer for them to finalize the order at the checkout process. This allows the customer to accept your store's policies, such as terms and conditions, privacy policy, and GDPR policies.",---
Accessing the Settings,"To access and modify the settings, follow these steps: 1. Log in to your CloudCart account. 2. Navigate to the ""Settings"" menu located on the left side of the dashboard. 3. Click on ""Cart and Checkout"" to open the relevant settings page. 4. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you will find options to configure the actions that occur after a customer clicks the ""Buy Now"" or ""Add to Cart"" button. By combining these options, you can create different scenarios and actions in the storefront to optimize the customer experience.",---
Forward to Checkout Page,"The ""Forward to Checkout Page"" option, when selected, immediately redirects the user to the checkout page after they click the ""Add to Cart"" or ""Buy Now"" button. This option streamlines the checkout process and reduces distractions for customers who prefer a quick and direct purchasing experience. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page.",---
Forward to Cart Page,"The ""Forward to Cart Page"" option, when selected and enabled, displays a side panel with the cart contents after the user clicks the ""Add to Cart"" or ""Buy Now"" button. This side panel allows the user to view and edit their cart without leaving the product page, maintaining engagement with the store's offerings. This option is particularly useful for stores that wish to keep customers on the product page while also providing easy access to the cart. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page and ensure the ""Enable side panel"" checkbox is selected.",---
Show Confirmation Pop-up,"The ""Show Confirmation Pop-up"" option, when selected, presents a pop-up window confirming that a product has been successfully added to the cart. This older method of displaying cart updates can also be utilized to upsell or cross-sell products by featuring additional items in the pop-up window. The confirmation pop-up can be displayed when adding products from both individual product pages and listing pages. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page.",---
Do Nothing,"The ""Do Nothing"" option is an excellent choice for grocery stores or B2B businesses that want to enable customers to add products to their carts quickly without any distractions or additional steps. When this option is selected, a small widget appears next to the ""Add to Cart"" button, allowing users to increase or decrease the product quantity directly on the product page. This streamlined option minimizes distractions during the shopping experience, making it ideal for stores that prioritize efficiency. To enable this option, click on the corresponding radio button in the settings page.",---
Side Panel (Default Option),"The default option for CloudCart stores is the side panel, which appears when a user adds a product to their cart. This panel allows customers to view and edit their cart contents while remaining on the product page, striking a balance between engagement and convenience. The side panel provides customers with the option to proceed to the checkout, close the panel, or view their cart by clicking the corresponding buttons. By default, this option is pre-selected in the settings page, but can be changed by selecting a different option.",---
How Shared Carts Work,"If you go to the cart, you can see that the link is your cart's unique link. You can copy this link and open it through a brand new browser or send it to your friends or customers through email or chat applications. When someone clicks on that link, the products in the cart of the previous user will be transferred, and a brand new cart with the same items will be created for that particular user. This allows sharing the cart content between devices without affecting the original cart.",---
Merging Carts,"Another feature related to cart management is the ability to merge carts. If you are not logged in and have items in your cart from a previous session, when you log in on a new device, the system will identify your cart items and offer you the option to merge your existing and current cart items. This is useful for finalizing orders that you may have forgotten or combining items from different carts.",---
Merging Carts Demonstration,"To demonstrate how cart merging works, we will use two different browsers to simulate two separate devices. In the first browser, we have an account with five products in the cart. In the second browser, we clear out the cart and add new products that were not in the original cart. Then, we log in to the same account, and as soon as we do, all items from the original cart are transferred and merged with the items from the current session. This means that all products from the original cart have been transferred to the new device, and you don't need to search for them again when switching devices. The same cart with merged items can be viewed on different devices, making it a convenient feature.",---
Cart Merging and Sharing Settings,"To enable cart merging, go to Settings > Cart and Checkout Settings and toggle on the ""Merge Carts"" option. The cart sharing feature is built-in, so you don't have to do anything to enable it.",---
Adding an existing domain,"Go to your CloudCart admin panel, navigate to Settings > Domains, and click on Add Existing Domain. Enter your custom domain (e.g., bigrelease.com) and submit.",---
Choose DNS management option,"You will be presented with two options: Fully Managed DNS Records (recommended) or Managing your domain as a CNAME record. For this scenario, choose the Fully Managed DNS Records option.",---
Enable DNS record management,Enable the DNS record management from the admin panel and proceed with the setup.,---
Change the name servers,"After selecting the Fully Managed DNS Records option, the system will prompt you to change your current name servers to the provided name servers. Follow the instructions and update your name servers at your domain registrar (e.g., name.com).",---
Verify and set as primary,"Once you have updated your name servers, return to the CloudCart admin panel and click on Verify. Once verified, set the custom domain as your primary domain.",---
Adding a subdomain,"Go to your CloudCart admin panel, navigate to Settings > Domains, and click on Add Existing Domain. Enter your subdomain (e.g., shop.bigrelease.com) and submit.",---
Choose CNAME record management option,"You will be presented with two options: Fully Managed DNS Records or Managing your domain as a CNAME record. For this scenario, choose the Managing your domain as a CNAME record option.",---
Update CNAME record,"The system will provide you with a unique CNAME value. Log in to your domain registrar's control panel (e.g., name.com) and create a new CNAME record with your subdomain as the host (e.g., shop) and the provided CNAME value as the target.",---
Verify and set as primary,"Once you have updated the CNAME record, return to the CloudCart admin panel and click on Verify. Once verified, set the subdomain as your primary domain.",---
Troubleshooting and Support,"If you encounter any issues during the custom domain setup process, please refer to CloudCart's knowledge base or contact CloudCart support for assistance. They can help diagnose and resolve any issues, ensuring that your custom domain or subdomain is correctly linked to your CloudCart store.",---
Introduction to Order Statuses,"Order statuses are important in CloudCart because different events occur based on the order status, such as inventory reduction, customer notifications, and invoice creation. Understanding the intricacies of order statuses is essential for both you and your merchants.",---
Three Main Statuses,"In CloudCart, an order has three main statuses: (1) fulfillment status, which indicates whether an order has been fulfilled or not; (2) payment status, which can have various sub-statuses such as completed, declined, pending, and refunded; and (3) the main order status, which is determined based on the fulfillment and payment status.",---
Offline Payment Methods,"An order's status can be ""pending"" when an offline payment method is used, such as cash on delivery, bank transfers, or other offline payment methods that will be added in the future. Offline payment methods do not involve direct payment or payment verification, so the status remains ""pending"" until the merchant takes further action.",---
Preparing and Shipping an Order with Offline Payment Methods,"When an order is placed with an offline payment method, the merchant is expected to perform actions such as preparing the shipment and packaging the order. In this case, the status will be ""pending,"" and the merchant can update the order status to ""fulfilled"" when they have prepared the order for shipping.",---
Updating the Payment Status,"The payment status can be updated manually by the merchant when using offline payment methods. For example, when an order is placed with cash on delivery, the merchant needs to confirm the payment and mark the order as paid to update the overall order status.",---
Updating Order Status to Fulfilled,"When you mark an order as fulfilled, the order status will change accordingly, and the customer will receive an email notification about their fulfilled order. Depending on the settings you have chosen, the available stock for the ordered items may be reduced at this point.",---
Adjusting Inventory Reduction Settings,"You can configure when the inventory should be reduced: either when the order status is ""pending"" and ""fulfilled"" or when it's ""paid"" and ""fulfilled."" This setting can be adjusted based on your preferences and the type of payment methods you primarily work with.",---
Inventory Reduction for Cash on Delivery Orders,"If you predominantly work with cash on delivery orders and have chosen the ""pending"" and ""fulfilled"" setting for inventory reduction, the available stock for the ordered items will be immediately reduced once the order is placed. However, if you have chosen the ""paid"" and ""fulfilled"" setting, the stock will only be reduced when the order is marked as paid or fulfilled.",---
Inventory Reduction for Directly Paid Orders,"If an order is placed with a direct payment method, such as a credit card, the inventory reduction will depend on the settings you have chosen. With the ""pending"" and ""fulfilled"" setting, the inventory will not be reduced immediately upon placing the order, but rather when the order is marked as fulfilled. On the other hand, if you have selected the ""paid"" and ""fulfilled"" setting, the inventory will be reduced as soon as the order is marked as fulfilled.",---
Order Status Transitions,"An order should not transition back to a ""pending"" status once it has been marked as ""paid."" The ""pending"" status is the initial status of an order, and it should only progress through the subsequent stages (e.g., ""fulfilled"" and ""paid"") to reflect the actual state of the order. Proper management of order statuses is crucial for maintaining accurate inventory and ensuring a smooth order processing experience for both the merchant and the customer.",---
Shipment and Additional Order Status,"Once an order is marked as fulfilled, a shipping notice or invoice may be generated and sent to the customer, along with any other relevant notifications (e.g., via email, Messenger, Viber, or any other connected platform). Customers can also assign other order statuses, such as ""canceled"" or ""refund issued."" It's important to note that once an order is marked as fulfilled, its status cannot be changed back to ""pending""",---
Canceling and Refunding a Shipped Order,"To cancel or refund a fulfilled order, you can use the available options within the order management interface. When an order is marked as both ""fulfilled"" and ""canceled,"" this indicates that the order has been fulfilled but later canceled. Keep in mind that orders marked as ""fulfilled"" cannot have their shipping or billing addresses modified.",---
Modifying Unshipped Orders,"To modify an order's shipping or billing address, the order must be marked as ""unfulfilled."" You can perform this action by selecting the appropriate status within the order management interface. Once an order is marked as ""unfulfilled,"" you'll be able to edit the necessary information.",---
Payment Statuses,"In addition to order statuses, payment statuses are another crucial aspect of order management. Understanding and managing payment statuses accurately ensures a smooth and efficient order processing experience for both the merchant and the customer.",---
Marking an Order as Paid,"When marking an order as paid (in this case, using cash on delivery), you will be asked to enter a reference number. Once an order is marked as paid, it can never be marked as unpaid again. This restriction is in place to prevent merchants from manipulating the platform and to ensure compliance with legal requirements in various countries, such as Bulgaria.",---
Canceling or Refunding a Paid Order,"While you cannot mark a paid order as unpaid, you can still cancel or refund it. If you attempt to cancel an order that has already been paid, you may receive a notification stating that only open orders can be canceled. In this case, you can't cancel the order, but you can issue a refund. This process might involve contacting the customer, who may have requested the cancellation of their order over the phone, and confirming that they will not receive the order. If the order was marked as paid, you can't cancel it, but you can issue a refund and record the refund as processed.",---
Returning to the Original Status of an Order,"Once you have marked an order as paid, it will be shown as such in the order management interface. When preparing the order for shipment, the system will update the order status to ""completed"" after the order has been fulilled and payment has been received. At this point, there is no further action required for this order. The system automatically marks an order as completed when both the shipping and payment statuses are in a positive state (i.e., the shipping status is marked as ""fulilled"" and the payment status is marked as ""paid""). When these conditions are met, the order is considered completed and can be seen as such in the order management interface. Completed orders can only be archived.",---
Understanding Order Status and Archive Function,"In the order management interface, you can filter orders by their status, such as ""completed"" orders. Completed orders that appear in gray indicate that they have been archived. Archiving an order allows you to remove it from active processing, but still retain its information for future reference.",---
Unarchiving and Editing Archived Orders,"To unarchive an order, simply select the appropriate action within the order management interface. Once unarchived, you can perform various operations on the order, such as editing and updating its status. Keep in mind that while an order is archived, it cannot be edited or have its status changed. Instead, you can only view its history and access its associated invoice. Unarchiving the order will enable you to perform additional actions as needed.",---
Using Filters to Manage Orders,"Within the order management interface, you can use various filters to view orders based on their status, payment method, or delivery status. This allows you to easily manage and prioritize orders according to your business needs.",---
Two Main Groups of Statuses,"There are two main groups of statuses in the system: system-generated statuses and custom statuses added by the client. System-generated statuses include order status, delivery status, and payment status. You can also add your own custom statuses to the main order status to better manage and categorize your orders.",---
Adding Custom Statuses,"Custom statuses allow you to mark orders that require special attention, such as those needing additional processing or follow-up. By using custom statuses, you can easily filter and view orders that need further action. Custom statuses can be added to the main order status and can be used for filtering orders in the future. However, custom statuses do not trigger email notifications to customers.",---
Webhooks and Status Notifications,"While custom statuses do not send email notifications to customers, they can initiate the sending of webhook messages. Webhooks are a powerful tool for transferring information from one software environment to another. System-generated statuses, on the other hand, send email notifications to customers to inform them about the status of their orders. In summary, all statuses, whether system-generated or custom, can be sent via webhooks, but only system-generated statuses trigger email notifications to customers.",---
Understanding Order Statuses,"Orders have three main statuses: shipping status, payment status, and overall order status. The shipping status can be either ""Fulfilled"" or ""Not fulfilled"" The payment status has several types, which are determined by the corresponding payment provider. If there is no payment provider, it is considered an offline payment method.",---
Payment Status Types,"Payment status types include ""Completed,"" ""Cancelled,"" ""Expired,"" ""Disputed,"" ""Frozen,"" ""Pending,"" ""Requested,"" and ""Initiated."" These statuses come from electronic payment methods and are system-generated.",---
Combining Shipping and Payment Statuses,"The overall order status combines both the shipping and payment statuses. For example, an order can have a ""Fulfilled"" shipping status but an ""Unpaid"" payment status, or it can have a ""Paid"" payment status but a ""Not Shipped"" shipping status. Separating these statuses into three categories allows merchants to easily understand the current state of each order and enables the online store software to relay this information to other systems in real-time. This enables a wide range of functionalities and allows for the implementation of necessary business logic.",---
connecting to google maps via the api key,"one of our prize accomplishments is the convenient and fast checkout, through which users do not waste time in annoyingly entering personal information and delivery address when completing an order.

importing products through an xml file,"importing products with an xml file is one of the fastest and easiest ways to import a large catalogue of product content into your store.
often xml importing may be necessary if you are working with a partner/distributor who provides you with an xml structure directory.
in this article, you will find information about what an xml structure is and how to use it to activate the application we have developed, to help you manage the product catalogue in your online store.
what are an xml file and xml structure? the idea of data correction is helpful for understanding xml.
people have been creating documents for centuries and have been adding signs to them for just as long.
correcting a document is how we determine the structure, meaning, and appearance of information in a document. in the world of computers, ""correction"" has evolved into ""markup.""
marking is the process of using codes, called labels (or sometimes tags), to determine the structure, appearance, and, in the case of xml, the meaning of the data.
here is how a sample xml file it looks like, opened in a browser containing information about hundreds of products: in the photo above, you see tags that contain each item of the product summary information.
each element of a product, such as an identification code, name, category, description, tags, brand, price, weight, quantity, photo, variety, and value, must be enclosed with an opening and closing tag in order for the information to be read correctly and to can be imported to your store using the xml import application.
the names of the tags themselves, which contain each element of the product, are defined by the creator of the xml file. a well-crafted xml file meets a set of very strict rules that govern xml.
if a file does not comply with these rules, xml stops working.
for example, in the code sample above, each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag, so that the sample meets one of the rules for proper layout.
if you remove a tag and try to open this file, you will see an error message and the program will prevent you from using the file.
you do not need to know the rules for creating well-formed xml (though they are easy to understand), but you should remember that you can only share xml data between programs and systems if the data is well-formed.
if you cannot open an xml file, it is likely that the file is not well-formed. here you can see the structure of a well-formed sample xml file. when should i use the xml import application?
*when you have provided online information (in a structure different than xml, that can be converted into xml) for a large number of products, that you want to sell in your online store *when your partner or distributor provides you with information about the products you want to sell in the form of an xml file if the product information you want to upload to your store has not been collected in one place and the products are not many, you do not need to use this importer.
in this case, you can manually upload any product to your store, which is also done quite fast and easily in the products section of your store's control panel.
from here you can see our sample cloudcart template. the first step in task settings in the xml application 1. go into your control panel > apps > all apps > xml products import. 2.
after you log into the app, click on the button create a job in the top right-hand corner and carry on with the settings: job name - write down a name for the xml task against the criteria and the purpose for which you create it.
the name will only be visible in the control panel, in the list of tasks in the import application xml url - paste the full url into the xml file here.
if you have an xml file, first upload it in the settings > files section of your control panel to get a link to put in this field import all products in the category - use the drop-down menu to select an existing product category into which all xml task products will be imported.
if the xml file contains product category information, you don't need to use this drop-down menu, just skip it and continue to the next task settings import all products to the vendor - use the drop-down menu to select an existing brand into which all xml task products will be imported.
if the xml file contains product brand information, you do not need to use this drop-down menu, just skip it and continue to the next task settings import all products as - from the drop-down menu, select whether the products should be imported as directly visible in your store or imported as unpublished.
once the entire task is completed and the products are imported, you can use the quick tools in the products section to publish all the products at once xml product tag - enter the tag in the xml structure here that contains all the other tags and information for each product.
xml product tag in this structure for example: e - in this case, in the first step of the task settings, you have to enter ""product"" for the product tag.
assign to the main xml job - if you have a basic xml task and the one you are currently creating must run on it, you can select the basic one from this drop-down menu.
for example, if you have one xml product feed and a second xml feed with inventory, then the first xml (product one) will be based on the stock xml rows - enter the maximum number of rows in the xml feed here for the system to check for a product tag.
if the feed structure is correct, you should not need to change the number of lines and the product tag is sure to be included in the first 500 lines track inventory - through this option the quantity of all products that will be imported will be monitored by the system.
when an item is sold, the remaining quantity will be recalculated from the total set quantity of the product disable missing products - disable products that are now missing from the xml feed, but were added earlier from the feed continue selling - if you enable this option the system will allow ordering the product even if the quantity of the product is 0
task id number - enter a task number. it will serve to distinguish or merge the tasks you have enabled in the application. task id allows you to create multiple import tasks that work in sync.

if the data is invalid and a ""login error"" message is displayed, the system will not allow you to proceed. 3. in the field price column you can choose which prices to work with.
whether the prices of the imported products should be shown with the dealer price (this price is without vat) or with the final price with vat included.
we recommend that you work with dealer prices and set a specific markup for each category.
increasing the prices of different product categories by different percentages gives you the freedom to be flexible enough in pricing to your end customers. 4. also does not send information about the product quantities, only statuses of the type - limited/out of stock/ in stock, without exact values, are received.
therefore, in the following three fields, on hand - in stock/minimum and on order - out of stock, you can define the number of products for which a product will be considered in stock/with limited quantities or out of stock, upon receiving one of the statuses we mentioned above.
ex. for product x comes the status ""on hand - in stock"", in this case, you can enter as a quantity of the product 5 pieces.
if the minimum status for a product comes, you can enter ""1"", which means that the products with the minimum status will accept a quantity of ""1pc"". 4.
to save the entered data, click the save button. 5. the next step is related to the ""mapping"" of the categories.

from the choose the category from also section, from the drop-down menu you can see all the categories submitted by also, and on the right are the categories in your store.
choose a suitable one that matches the one in also.
in order to be able to synchronize the categories, it is good to have created suitable ones in advance, to which you want to add (import) products from the also catalog.
here you can see a detailed article on how to create and manage product categories. 7. from the field percentage - set the percentage by which to increase the price of products in this category.
the price you set in the previous setting is the one that increases (in our case, this is the dealer).
the dealer price is without vat, which means that you always have to increase the price by more than 20% so as to generate a profit. 8. click the save button to save the settings. 9.
in the newly opened window you will see several buttons. before pressing the button to start the task, let's look at the last two - also priority and also interval.
also priority - this means that if you have another 500 tasks in the queue (cloudcart works with tasks and queues, you can track them from settings> tasks in the queue), pressing this button can prioritize the execution of tasks from also by a certain (%) percentage, so that they be executed before some of the others.
this is done by purchasing also priority in percentages. the maximum percentage with which you can speed up the task from also is 80%.
also interval - as mentioned above, the app syncs all products every 24 hours. however, you can change this by purchasing an additional runtime and shortening the sync time.
here you also have the opportunity to choose from different packages - from 18 to 5 hours. start job - from this button, you can start the synchronization.
once you do that, the other features will not be visible. a new window will appear: when the task starts running you will see a progress bar of the execution.
this indicates that the application is running and syncing correctly. if you want to go back to the settings again, you must stop the synchronization from the stop the importing process button.
when the task completes successfully you will see a message that the import is 100% complete and all products have been uploaded.
if there are any that have not been imported successfully, their number will appear in the dark purple box failed imports (0). 10.
after the import is complete from the menu, in the products section you can see all uploaded products.
if a product is no longer available from also, it will also be removed from your catalog if you have uploaded it.
if the products you import from the also catalog are uploaded to your store without a photo and descriptions, you need to contact also to include this option (service) in your account.

how to activate the units app?,"
if you have an online store that offers food products, or other goods that can not be sold individually (per piece), but need different units of measurement, the application ""units"" is suitable for your site.
if people rely on you to always have everything you need for the household, when shopping on site at a local store is not an option, then your store needs units of measure to add to your products.
thus, customers will be able to choose the desired quantity and cuts, and the system will make the appropriate calculations according to the ordered quantity.
in this section: settings add a unit of measure to a product xml import - products with units of measure sync via api edit product quantity in order settings 1.
to set up and activate the application, you must first install it by logging in to the admin panel of your store, choose apps > all apps, and select the units app. click the install button. 2. select from the on / off button whether the unit of measurement to be displayed in the quantity selection field, together with its symbols after the decimal point, when the customer orders the given product.
if this option is off, only an integer will be visible without the unit name (kg, g, l, etc.). 3.
after installing the application, go to the products section > product units and click the create new unit button located at the top right of your screen. 4.
in the window that opens, fill in the title and short title of the unit of measure you are creating. in the decimal point field, enter the number of characters to display after the decimal point.
fill in the primary unit of measure field after creating all units of measure. 5. enter all the units of measure you need depending on the type of products in your store.
after doing so, return to the created units of measure and select the primary unit of measure from the drop-down menu in the primary unit of measure field, ie if you create a gram, the base unit is a kilogram, if you create a milliliter, the base unit is a liter and so on 6.
in the next field quantity in the basic unit of measure, write how many times the unit of measurement you create is contained in the basic unit of measurement, example: if you create a gram, the basic unit is a kilogram, and the quantity you need to enter is 1000, in 1 kg there is 1000 g, etc. 7.
you can see all the units you have created in the products > product units. if you want to delete a unit of measure, tick it and select delete from tools. add a unit of measure to a product 1.
to set a specific unit of measure for a product that cannot be sold per piece, from the main menu in your admin panel, select products and select the desired product.
in the product configuration section, you have to enter the minimum quantity and unit of measure of the product.
minimum quantity is functionality that allows you to set certain restrictions and rules when buying products. if you sell bulk goods (watermelons, pumpkins, etc.)
you can set a minimum quantity that can be purchased. also, this option is useful when you do not want and do not think it will be profitable to sell less than a certain amount of certain products.
in the example, the product we used is potatoes and we want to set the settings so that the minimum quantity that a customer can order is 1 kg, so in the field, we fill in ""1"" and from the drop-down menu select the unit of measurement kg. 2. in the next field, enter the product price for the unit of measure you are using. 3. step in - here you need to enter by how much the customer can increase/decrease the quantity of the product with each press of the +/- button. in our case, we have set 0.200 g.

in addition to referring to the unit in which the product is sold, you can also use this field to enter any text if you choose.
if you leave it blank, the minimum amount of product you have entered in the corresponding field will be taken into account. 5.
in the sku and barcode fields, enter the appropriate product identifiers. 6. quantity - enter the quantity you have available from this product.
to use this option you need to have the track inventory button turned on.
in the store this information will be displayed as follows: if you choose not to show this information to customers you can turn off the option in the my store section > widgets >
products > detail information for a product. 7. in the last field weight it is necessary to fill in the weight to calculate the value of the shipment when sending.
it refers to the basic unit of measure but may be different because of the product packaging or other things you add to the product when you send it to the customer.
therefore, include the weight of the package (carton, box, etc.), if any, so that the system can correctly calculate the amount that has to be paid.
in our case we put 1,100 kg, assuming that 0.100 g is the package.
thus, if a customer orders, for example, 6,450 kg, the final total weight will be 7,090 g, because of this additional 0.100 g, which are added to each kilogram.
xml import - products with units of measure if you are using xml import, you already have several new mapping fields added to the import task, in which you can enter the corresponding values to apply - minimum order amount, product unit measurement, product unit measurement step value, and product unit measurement visualization.
thus, all values in the new fields will be able to be imported and updated via the xml import application.
sync via api in the cloudcart documentation, there are references to units of measurement (units). you can see more information in product resource. several values have been added to attributes.
the main value that needs to be changed is unit_short_name, in which we add the short name of the unit itself (in our case kg).
when updating or adding a product, this short name must be provided in order to be able to specify the basic unit of measurement of the product concerned. all other values are read-only.
edit product quantity in order you can edit the quantity of products ordered on already placed orders and in decimal numbers, not as before only integers.
to edit a quantity, select the relevant order and click edit.
if a customer has ordered 6.45 g of potatoes, but the weight is 0.050 g more when weighing, you can change the value of the quantity, so the system will recalculate the final price and subtract the ordered quantity from the total product quantity so as not to have any discrepancies subsequently.
this is all you need to know about the units app to make the right settings according to your online store and the products you sell.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000481615

how to import products from an xml file?,"importing products with an xml file is one of the fastest and easiest ways to import a large catalogue of product content into your store.
often xml importing may be necessary if you are working with a partner/distributor who provides you with an xml structure directory.
in this article, you will find information about what an xml structure is and how to use it to activate the application we have developed, to help you manage the product catalogue in your online store.
in this section: xml file structure install the application settings (1st step) settings (2nd step) settings (3rd step)
additional settings xml file structure the xml file must contain well-structured data. it contains tags that strongly resemble html tags.
an xml document is actually a text file that contains various xml declarations and tags, as well as text.
here is an example of an xml document that contains information about multiple products: in the photo above, you see tags that contain each item of the product summary information.
each element of a product, such as an identification code, name, category, description, tags, brand, price, weight, quantity, photo, variety, and value, must be enclosed with an opening and closing tag.
the opening and closing tags must have the same name, the closing tag being preceded by a slash (/ ""), in order for the information to be read correctly and to be imported to your store using the xml import application.
between these two tags is the content, i.e. the data included in the relevant section. there must be one basic element in which all the other elements are located. it's called document root.
in the example, this is the element. this opening main tag must have a closing one .
it contains many sub-tags, each of which has a closing tag and some information in between, for example: manufacturer tag manufacturer name .
the names of the tags themselves, which contain each element, are arbitrary, not strictly defined, and are determined by the creator of the xml file.
when imported, they will actually be linked to the already existing elements for a product. a well-formed xml file conforms to a set of very strict rules that govern xml.
if a file does not match them, the xml stops working. in the picture above you can see that each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag, this is one of the basic rules for well-formed xml.
if you remove a tag and try to open this file, you will see an error message and the program will prevent you from using the file.
you don't have to know the rules for creating well-formed xml, but you should remember that you can share xml data between programs and systems only if the data is properly formed.
if you cannot open an xml file, it is very likely that this file does not have the correct structure. here you can see the structure of a well-formed sample xml file.
install the application to use the xml import application, you need to have such an xml file or feed (a file provided in the form of a link from which information is constantly drawn).
another option is to have another source of information (a spreadsheet in google sheets, for example) to convert to xml format.
the information about a product in a table is usually contained on a single row, while in xml this information is on many rows that are enclosed in a single tag (for example, ).
that is, the horizontal data visualization type is converted to vertical in the xml file. 1. go to the admin panel of your store, section settings > files and click the upload files button in the upper right corner of your screen to upload the xml file, if you have one.
then copy the link and paste it into the browser to make sure it works. if there is a problem with the file, a message will appear on the screen. 2. the next step is to go to the apps>
all apps section and select xml import and the install button. settings (1st step) 1. click the create a job button to start a new job for import. job name - enter a name that will identify the job.
subsequently, it will be used to identify each product - from which job it was imported. the job name will only be visible in the control panel.
for example, if you are uploading products from a certain category (headphones), this may be the title of the job. xml url -
in the xml url link field, paste the link (xml feed) that you have or that you copied after uploading the xml file in the settings> files section.
import all products in the category - use the drop-down menu to select an existing product category in which to import all products from this xml job.
if the xml file contains product category information, you do not need to use this drop-down menu.
if the xml feed you upload contains products from only one category, you can select it in the first step, if you have not selected such a category, the system will expect you to select a category for each product in the second step.
if you don't have categories created in your store, see how you can create them here.
import all products to the vendor - use the drop-down menu to select an existing brand into which all products from this xml job will be imported.
if the xml file contains product brand information, you do not need to use this drop-down menu, just skip it and continue to the next step of the settings.
import all products as - from the drop-down menu, select whether the products should be imported as directly visible in your store or imported as unpublished.
once the entire job is completed and the products are imported, you can use the quick tools in the products section to publish all the products at once.
xml product tag - a field in which you need to enter important information, namely the product tag. in the xml file, the opening and closing tags define the beginning and end of a product.
in our case, this is the tag.
you need to enter the xml tag of the product from your xml file so that the parser (the script that reads xml files) can understand where a product starts and ends in the xml structure.
this tag can be any, there is no set standard, so look at how it is named in your file.
for example: the product tag contains all other tags and information for each product: assign to the main xml job -
the xml importer is fairly advanced software that can not only import but also update products. there can also be multiple sub-jobs that are attached to one main job.
that is, if you have started one main job for importing products, you can run other sub-jobs to it, through which to fill your product catalog.
this is a useful feature if all the products you want to upload are not in one file, but are divided into several.
in this case, you can run several jobs to work as one and thus merge the entire product catalog.
rows - enter the maximum number of rows in the xml feed here for the system to check for a product tag.
if the feed structure is correct, you should not need to change the number of lines and the product tag is sure to be included in the first 500 lines disable missing products - very useful functionality when working with feeds, because they are constantly updated.
if a product is out of stock or removed from the site of the distributor you work with, then this product will be automatically removed from your store when you update the feed.
track inventory - through this option the quantity of all products that will be imported will be monitored by the system.
when an item is sold, the remaining quantity will be recalculated from the total set quantity of the product continue selling - if you enable this option the system will allow ordering the product even if the quantity of the product is 0
task id number - no matter what identifier you choose, it is important that it be unique to each job. if there are jobs with the same id, the products are likely to conflict.
choose fixed discount type - through the xml importer it is possible to add product discounts, but for this purpose, your xml file must contain such a value (original price and sale price).
if you enable this option, you must create a discount from the marketing > discounts menu and select fixed discount. the xml import application only works with this type of discount.
once you create the discount, it will be used for constant updating when the xml feed contains such information.
compare by - to prevent product duplication, you can compare products in the store with the ones you import by official id, sku or barcode.
if a certain product already exists in the store, it will not be imported during the current task - it will only be updated if necessary.
action - you have the option to import and update the products or just update them. this means that the app also allows you to synchronize the products without importing new ones.
settings (2nd step) after checking the data entered in the first step, use the save button and go to step 2, where you will specify how to import the data from the xml feed into the product catalog of your store.
xml product id - from the drop-down menu, select the product id that meets this condition so that there are no products with the same sku or id, for example.
on the right, in the drop-down menu, you will see the structure of your xml file.
choose the identifier for your products by which they differ from each other so that when updating the xml feed, it does not happen that two products that have, say, the same id as the identifier, update in the same way.
title - select the tag that contains the name of each product in the file. it can be very different (name, product name, validation name, title, etc. in our sample file, this is the tag.
short description - if you have such information in your file, select the appropriate tag. if you don't have one, you can skip this field.
description - the description of a product can be quite long and contain various signs, links, photos, etc. select the appropriate tag that opens and closes the product description.
in our file, this is the tag
if there are photos in the description of a product, the ""xml import"" software will extract them and upload and save them directly in the storage of your store, so that they become part of the description of the respective products.
when importing products, if the xml file contains tabs whose descriptions are a link to embed video from youtube (link only), as here: video https://www.youtube.com/embed/cljj2gucic in this case, the link will be replaced with a code that will be able to directly display the video.
seo title and seo meta description - you may not select them, they will be automatically created from the name and description of the product itself. old url address- serves when we migrate a store.
if you set a value for the old url of the product itself, the xml importer will automatically create 301 links so as to preserve the positioning/indexing of the product. see more here.
price - select the tag for the original price (if you have one with a discount). discounted price - choose a tag that matches the discounted price.
sku - select the tag that matches the sku of the product barcode - select the tag that matches the barcode of the product quantity - select the tag that matches the quantity of the product weight -
if there is such information in your file, select the appropriate tag new - the products will be marked as new.
this functionality is useful if you upload a file with new products only and want them to be marked as such.
if you want a row of the above to be constantly updated, you need to tick the rows you want, as shown in the photo above.
however, keep in mind that the more rows you choose to update, the slower the import will be because many metrics of different products will be compared so that the software can update according to the specified criteria.
description tabs if you have several descriptions for one product in the feed, this functionality allows you to create several tabs with these descriptions, respectively.
if you have only one description, you do not need to choose anything. category property the structure of a property is the same as the product definition: you have one summary tag for all properties.
each property has a name and a value. it must have a closing and opening tag. from the drop-down menu, select the corresponding tags.
property values can be several, but they can be separated by commas in the third step of the settings.
property value - most often accepts the value of the property, so you can select the same tag here. in the next section, select the tag that applies to the brand (manufacturer).
variants to import product variants, your xml file must contain product variants groups. the same logic is followed for the variants as for the properties.
again, you need to carefully select the appropriate tags from your xml file.
image manager if you have multiple photos of a product in an xml file, they can be grouped under one tag and separated by commas.
in the third step of the settings, you can create a rule in which the software, when it detects a comma, separates the individual elements and considers them as a separate things. settings (3rd step)
in this step, you can create additional operations and rules for importing products from the xml file into your store directory.
for example, if you want the contents of any of the tags to be supplemented or modified by certain values, you can set up all of these actions and change the product import as needed.
this setting is commonly used if you have a value in the xml feed, and you wish to upload it as a higher one in the product catalogue.
you can create a variety of operations, depending on the contents of your file and the way you need to model it.
it is important to note that if you correctly specified the product tag in the first step of the xml upload, then in the next steps you will use the drop-down menus, through which the system will already successfully show you the information from the file and you just need to indicate what each tag from the xml feed should be used for.
note that the way the text is written (lowercase / uppercase) in the field shown in the photo below must match the way it is written in the file, otherwise no match will be found and the operation will not be performed.
when you're done, save the job from the button in the upper right corner of the screen. the job becomes active, it is queued, when the time comes for its implementation it will start.
when you upload photos, they upload with a slight delay, as a group of clusters - servers, process each uploaded photo.
the photos are optimized, the necessary filters are added to them, the quality is optimized so that they can be loaded and opened as quickly as possible on your site, so that they are of optimal quality.
additional settings once the task is started, it never stops, the next launches happen every 12 hours - xml importing starts to update the content if there is a change such as new products, availability, prices, etc.
you can increase the priority of your job, as well as shorten the implementation interval - instead of 12 hours you can make it run every 6 hours, for example.
from the xml import priority task button, you can purchase a priority for your job. that is, it will be completed by 20, 40, 60 or 80% before the other jobs.
from the other button xml import interval you can change the interval for starting the given task.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000484109
xml product data synchronization,"
in this section: xml structure installation and settings step 1 settings step 2 settings step 3 additional packages product synchronization is performed through the xml synchronization application by providing information about products from an external source (xml file / feed) to the cloudcart system.
product data is compared to products already available in your store.
in this way, easily and continuously over a period of time, you could update various information about the price and quantity of the product, whether a product is new, in promotion, hidden or out of stock.
the advantage of this application is that it saves you tons of time to import and update products in your store, their availability, prices, and other attributes that require more frequent updates.
at any time when there is any change, without the need for human intervention, at a certain interval, the xml file/feed is regenerated by the system from which you draw information and the file or feed is uploaded via an internet connection.
this flow of information is constantly updated and fed to your store.
example: if you have warehousing software (erp), through which you want to supply your online store with information about prices and availability, the easiest and most accessible way to do it is through xml.
xml structure the xml file must contain well-structured data. it comprises tags that strongly resemble html tags.
an xml document is actually a text file that contains various xml declarations and tags, as well as text.
here is an example of an xml document containing information about multiple products: in this photo, you see tags that contain various elements of the general information about the given products.
each element of a product such as a name, category, product id, description, brand, price, weight, quantity, photo, variety, value, etc. must be enclosed with an opening and closing tag.
the opening and closing tags must have the same name, the closing one being preceded by a slash (/ "") so that the information can be read correctly. between these two tags is the content, ie.
the data included in the relevant section. there must be one basic element in which all the other elements are located. it's called document root. in the example, this is the element.
this opening main tag must have a closing one . the opening and closing tags are referred to as a tag pair.
each tag pair contains many sub-tags, each of which has a closing and opening tags and some information in between, for example, manufacturer tag: manufacturer name .
tag names are not strictly defined and are determined by the creator of the xml file.
during the synchronization, they will actually be linked to the already existing elements for the given products in your store. installation and settings step 1 1.
to install the application, log in to your admin panel, apps section> all applications> xml sync and click the install button. 2. from the create a job button you can create one. 3.
in the window that opens, enter the job name. choose a name to help you identify the specific task. it could be the name of the partner who provided you with the xml feed or whatever you decide. 4.
in the xml url field, paste the link that you have or that was provided to you. 5. xml product tag - in this field it is important to determine which is the xml tag from your xml feed that defines the product. in our case, this is the ""item"" tag. this tag name can be any.
to make sure the tag you enter in this field is correct, always open the feed/file you have to check. this tag identifies each item contained in your feed.
the xml file can be opened by pasting the link in a web browser. 6. rows - select how many rows, the maximum number of lines in which the product tag exists, the software to read in order to find content.
this is important because when you go to the second step the software reads the whole file and takes its structure and visualizes it in the second step to make the corresponding ""fitting"", the so-called ""mapping"".
mapping one value from the xml file to another product value from your store. it is important the number of rows that you have chosen contains the opening and closing product tag.
the default rows are 500 and usually, this number is enough, but if you have a larger xml file you can change it. note that a larger number of rows slows down parsing. 7.
product compare - in this field you must carefully choose the product id on which the comparison to the file and your store will be performed.
the id you select (eg sku) must match the products in your store, ie the sku of a particular product in the file must match the sku of that same product in your store for synchronization to take place successfully. 8. choose fixed discount type - product discounts can also be added through the xml synchronizer. if the file you have contains a discounted price, it will be reflected in your store.
when there is no discount in the file, the original price of the product or zero may be written in the discount price tag.
this does not mean that the price will be recorded as zero, but simply the software will not take it into account in this case.
to be able to use this option, you must first create a fixed discount from the marketing > discounts section. 9. disable missing products- a very useful feature, but you have to be careful with it.
activating this option means that any product in your store that is not present in the xml feed will be unpublished no matter how it is imported into the store. .
this option is useful if you have a feed that you are sure contains all the products that you want to be displayed in your store.
those that are no longer provided by that feed will be automatically unpublished.
if a product has variants and only one of these variants is missing in the file, then this variety will be with quantity 0.
if all variations are missing in the file, the product will be stopped by the application.
​ from the drop-down menu, you can select specific tasks created by xml import (if you have any) to be unpublished, all others won't be. 10. enable existing products - this option is the opposite of the above. if you enable it, then all products that have been unpublished but are contained in the file will be reactivated.
from the drop-down menu, you can select specific tasks created by xml import (if you have any) to be activated, all others will not be published. settings step 2
in the second step of the settings, you will see predefined values that come with the application itself. these values must be linked to the values from your file.
for each value (sku, price, discount price, quantity, etc.) you must select the corresponding one from the xml file you have.
if there is no information about some of the values in your file (eg local pickup) you can leave the field blank. all other fields need to be mapped.
if you want a row of the above to be constantly updated, you need to tick the rows you want, as shown in the photo above.
this means that the information in the selected rows will be updated each time the task is started. settings step 3
in the third step, you can create additional operations and rules for their implementation during synchronization.
if we say in the price tag, in addition to the value (49), there is also the currency ($, eu) in order for the file to be readen correctly by the system, you must create a rule.
in this case, you must create the following operation and a rule for its implementation: under this condition, the software will look for the line (value) that we have chosen for the price and if it contains eur, it will replace it with an empty field, ie only the price itself will be taken into account.
a similar rule can be created if text (eg in stock) is contained in the quantity tag instead of the number itself (eg 100): you can create a variety of operations, depending on the contents of your file and the way you need to model it.
note that the way the text is written (lowercase / uppercase) in the field shown in the photo below must match the way it is written in the file, otherwise no match will be found and the operation will not be performed.
when you're done with the settings, save the job from the button in the upper right corner of the screen. this is your task (job).
once you have saved it, it becomes active, it ranks and when the time comes for its execution, it will start.
here you will see information about the remaining products, ie the products that remain to be synchronized after the task has started.
in the second column, you see the number of synchronized products, and in the last execution. you can stop the task from the on / off button.
additional packages once the task is started, it never stops, its next starts happen every 12 hours.
you have the opportunity to increase the priority of your task, as well as to shorten the sync interval - instead of 12 hours to run every 6 hours, for example.
from the xml sync priority task button you can purchase a priority to complete the task. that is, it will be completed by 20, 40, 60, or 80% before the other tasks.
from the other xml sync interval button, you can shorten the execution interval from 12 to every 9, 5, or 3 hours.
this is all you need to install and configure the xml sync application and create xml job.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000484294

to upload a product to olx, you first need to connect the categories in your store and their characteristics with those of olx so that you can upload the products you want in the next step.
one of the common reasons you can't upload your products is that you didn't do just that. why does the polycomp app import fewer products?
cloudcart calculates the number of products it processes from polycomp regardless of whether they have the status ‘in stock’ / ‘out of stock’ / ‘on the way’ or any other status.
in the app’s settings, there is an option to import products with a specific status and from here you can select all products or only those that are in stock.
if you select only products that are in stock, only products with the status ‘in stock’ will be imported.
we process 50 products from the entire polycomp catalog, for example, but we choose from these 50 products only those that are marked with the status ‘in stock’, so it is likely that the imported products will be fewer than 50.
the imported products will certainly be 50 if you select all products from the option to import products.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000486994

you need to select a category from olx that matches a product category from your store. if the olx category has a sub category (s), the last level must be selected.
for example, if you sell tricycles that are in the baby & child category > toys, but this category has a subcategory ""children's cars, bicycles, tricycles"", you must select this subcategory.
products cannot be published in a category that has branches (subcategories). the appropriate subcategory must be selected.
depending on the categories you choose, there are different requirements for some of them. there are those to which it is necessary to assign additional characteristics. eg.
more parameters must be connected to the category women's shoes. in this case, you will see a red button where you can set them.

xml feeds generator,"
the xml feeds generator application is an extremely useful tool and is intended for all merchants who have a large product range, have goods in stock, work with a distribution network and need various feeds to be updated and submitted in a short time interval.
this app replaces the cloudcart xml product catalog application, but with added additional functionalities that maximally improve and facilitate the work of merchants.
the xml feed generator includes everything a merchant needs so that he can ""feed"" his reseller partners with up-to-date information on prices and product availability in his store.
in addition, with the xml feed generator, you can restrict the sharing of sensitive information, such as the availability (exact quantity) you have of a product.
you can now set up your xml feed so that your partners only receive up-to-date information only about the status of the products (in stock/out of stock, etc.) without accurate information about the quantities you have in stock.
тhe information on each xml feed is updated every 6 hours. this means that information to your partners will be submitted every 6 hours. configuration 1.
to take advantage of the functionality of the xml feed generator application, log in to your admin panel, applications > all applications section, and select xml feeds generator > install. 2.
to create an xml feed, click the create new xml feed button. you can create one free xml feed containing up to 100 products.
if you want to generate more than one feed and / or to contains a larger number of products, you need to purchase additional packages. the payment is on an annual basis. 3.
in the window that opens, enter the name of your feed (you can use the name of the partner/distributor for whom it is intended).
this will make it easier for you to navigate if you have more than one feed. the url has entered automatically when the name is typed. 4.
in the next field from the drop-down menu, select which products to include in this feed - these can be products only from specific categories, from specific manufacturers, products with specific tags, specific products to choose from, or all products from your store.
if your xml feed contains products from specific categories, you can add as many product categories as you want. 5.
password protect - if you enable this option, the information contained in the xml feed will be protected.
it will not be traceable and can only be accessed after entering the appropriate username and password.
if you choose to protect it, you must provide this information to the recipient, the partner for whom the xml is intended. 6.
in the next section you can determine the price of the products contained in the specific feed.
for example, if you want to give a lower or higher price to the partner for whom the xml feed is intended, you can do so by turning on the option from the on / off button, select the type (percentage or fixed amount), and in the value field enter the corresponding value.
to reduce the price, you must enter a negative value, ie with a minus sign in front of the value ""-15"", and to increase the price of the products you enter only the number/value you want ""15"". 7.
in this section you can add trackers (utm parameters) to each product link so that you can track the information when a user on the other side (from the site where the feed is published) clicks. 8.
here are a few options you can turn on or off depending on what you want present in your xml: enable product quantity - if you enable this option, the xml feed will contain information about the exact product quantity you have in stock, if it is disabled, information will be provided only about product status (in stock /out of stock).
enable product discounted price - with this option you choose whether to include the discounted price of a product when it participates in a campaign.
if you enable this option and have reduced products in your store, then the next time the feed is regenerated, the reduced price will still be reflected and your partners will receive it.

append out-of-stock products - if the option is enabled, products that are not currently available will be added too. 9. when you are ready, save the settings from the save button.
the xml feed is not generated in real time, it is necessary to wait a while. the cloudcart system works with queue tasks that run sequentially.
when the time comes for your task to generate the xml feed, it will be generated and start transmitting information. it will be available to the users for whom it is intended.
from here you can copy the link of the xml feed and paste it into a browser to see it.
if it is still being generated you will see that it is ""in progress"" and you have to wait until the generation is complete. . once it's ready, you can see it before sending it to your partners.

as you may know, when you add your pixel to your website, your pixel id is publicly visible.
this means that anyone could find your pixel id, add it to the pixel base code and put it on their own website.
if this happens you usually get a notification that your pixel is being used on new domains. how to secure your facebook pixel 1.

facebook conversion api (capi) and how to implement it with your store,"in this article, we will show you how to use facebook conversions api with cloudcart. how to implement fb capi with your store? where to get the access token and the test event code from?
aggregated event measurement currently, facebook capi is a redundant data channel but in all likelihood in the future it will become a main channel for data events.
the web version of facebook pixel is remaining the main data source for the moment. to be able to use facebook capi, you have to do it simultaneously along with facebook pixel.
for now you can't switch to facebook capi only, you have to use it in tandem with the browser based pixel to send the same conversion events (e.g. viewcontent, purchase, addtocart, initiatedcheckout).
according to recent changes, apple's ios14 will give users more control over security by preventing advertisers from tracking off-platform activity through third-party browser cookies.
the conversion api (capi) is a revised version of what facebook used to call the server-side api (ssapi) and it allows sites to create custom events that could then be passed from a site’s server to facebook for attribution.
while browsers block cookie data from being passed on the browser side, they can't block the data that is passed on the server side.
so it will only become more valuable in time to use facebook capi for passing this data from your server. how to implement fb capi with your store? 1. first, you need to go to apps >
facebook dynamic ads. if your application is already installed and set you should edit settings from the corresponding button.
take a look of this article if you haven't installed the app in your store yet. 2. scroll down to the very bottom where you will see the option to enable capi in the facebook conversions api section.
turn it on from the button. enabling this channel requires payment. this feature is paid. all the other features you see are free of charge (fb pixel id, product catalog, etc.). 3.
in order to integrate with the facebook capi you need to add an access token and if you want to test the events you will also need test event code.
where to get the access token and the test event code from? 1. go to business.facebook.com. from business manager select event manager and then select the pixel you are using for your website. 2. go to settings, scroll down to the conversions api section and click on generate access token. copied the generate access token and paste it into the corresponding field in your admin panel. 3.
in order to test the events that are sending to facebook and verify the connection, go back to the events manager, test events section.
to test your browser events and check whether the events from the web browser are received correctly, enter your website url in the field and click on the open website button.
to test server events, the conversions one, copy the event code and paste it into your admin panel and click the save button.
to continue to monitor and analyze the behavior of your customers, facebook has made possible these same events to be sent from the server instead of the browser.
this way, even the events of a user who browses in private mode will be shared with advertisers through the server.
aggregated event measurement facebook's aggregated event measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from ios 14 users.
go to overview > aggregated event measurement to configure events to use aggregate event measurement.
you can assign the events that you believe matter most for your business based on the recent campaigns. to select events, click on configure web events button.
the next thing you have to do is to verify your domain. once you have verified it, click on the manage events button.
modification to events will automatically pause ad sets that are impacted by the event change for 72 hours. you can send up to eight events to facebook through the conversions api.
select the pixel for which you are adding an event and select the appropriate event.
currently, you can send viewcontent (customer is at the product page), addtocart, addtowishlist, search, initiatedcheckout (customer has started the checkout process), purchase events.
enable extended viewcontent - if you enable this option from the settings of fcebook dynamic ads app in your admin panel means that the viewcontent event will be fired not only on the product page but on the product listing page as well.
all information on the listing page, such as product identification number, quantity, prices, titles, basically everything related to the page, will be sent to facebook to get much more accurate targeting based on your customers' behavior.
you can prioritize events. the first event has the highest priority, the last event on the list has the lowest priority. you can rearrange events based on your goals.
when you have selected the events and their order, click submit and confirm your choice. note that you must wait 72 hours before changing these events again.
test your events before moving to production mode.
from an ios 14 device, you can, for example, add some product to the cart and if everything works properly you should expect addtocart event to appear in the test events section.
it usually takes some time. you can check if all your events are received correctly. when you are ready you can remove the test event code from the settings of facebook dynamic ads.
this will enable your application, your conversions api in production mode. adding test event code means that your events will be tracked too.
deduplicated events - facebook receives events from both the browser and the server. when there are two events with the same id, facebook deduplicates the server event.
however, when there is no browser event, the cases in which the user uses a privacy shield, the server event is taken into account.

switch your reporting from universal analytics to google analytics 4,"google analytics 4 is the new version of google universal analytics. it is the next level of measurement protocol.
ga4 is not just an amelioration of google universal analytics, but rather a completely new tool for tracking users across websites and applications.
instead of measuring “hits” on the session level like the old universal analytics, google analytics 4 measures “events” on the user property level.
the current version is expecting to be retired in 2022. another significant difference is that the monthly hit limits do not exist for ga4.
the free version of universal analytics had a monthly limit of 10 million visits. this will soon be out of date.
there are only limits to the number of different events that can be captured in ga4 to 500. but, there is no limit to the number of hits that can be accumulated while writing.
some of the main features of ga 4 are: more detailed data control customer-oriented measurements and customer life cycle reports more precise ai-powered insights and predictions deeper integration with google ads cloudcart will support both versions until google universal analytics is still in use.
and if you are currently using the old version it is advisable to use both versions together. if you are new to google analytics you will receive directly the new ga4.

when debug mode is enabled on your device, your data will be sent in ga in real-time only (without processing it).
this data will be filtered out and isolated from other devices (regular users) who are also generating events on your website and hence your actual data (dimensions and metrics in analytics) is not inflated.
test the integration open an incognito window and go to your website in order to test the integration.
then go to google analytics, select the bug icon at the bottom of the menu (debug view) wait for a while and check if your events are coming in the analytics.
as you can see in the picture below our integration is successful and all the events are coming to google analytics.

with the application you will be able to create different language versions of your store.
you could copy the entire product catalogue, such as products, product variations, category properties, product options, product specifications, your main store design, the navigation and the pages, including the pages created by the drag-and-drop page builder directly into your new store.
you can also copy all blog categories as well as the blog articles themselves in the target language.
thanks to ai technology provide by our partners from google you can automatically translate every single bit of text from your main store to the target language of your new store.
*once such a translation of the information in your store has been made, we advise you to review the texts to make sure there is no discrepancies and the translation is correct.
depending on the language at which the translation is made, slight inaccuracies are possible, if the content is more complicated. important!
before you make the translation into your new language version, make sure that the language of your main store's admin panel is no different from the storefront language.
e.g., if your main store is in english, then the admin panel settings must be in english too, so that a correct translation can be made of your new language version in your other store.
the translation is charged according to the characters number. installation go to your admin panel, apps > all apps section, and search for multilanguage.
click on the install button to continue with the app's settings. to copy and translate the newly created products, you need to buy additional packages first:
step 1 in step 1, you have two options after clicking the add language version - to create a new language version or link an existing store. 1.
if you already have an existing language version, you can associate it with your main store and take advantage of the multilanguage app's features.
to do this, click on the ""link existing store"" then you need to select the existing language version that you have and that works as a store before moving on to the next step.
the selected store will be displayed as an additional language version. you can see the date of creation, language, currency, store name and address, as well as its status.
from the button shown in the picture below, you can set additional settings: in the sidebar that opens, you will see two options: copy newly added products from your main store to the language version.
you can choose if you want these products to be translated and what elements to translate; what would be the approval method?
if you select approve automatically, you won't need to take action, and the system will copy the products from the main store to the respective store.
automatically delete products - if you enable the option, the products that have been deleted in the main store will be deleted in the language version as well.
this refers only to the products that are copied through the application. show language version on site - this setting refers to the language switcher on the storefront.
if you enable it customers will see small flags to change the language version. 2.
if you don't have a created language version or want to add a new one, use the ""add language version"" button in the upper right corner of the screen > create new language version.
if you are now creating a new language version of your primary store: first, you need to choose a domain name for the new language version of your store.
the name may be your main domain with the added abbreviation of the language you want to translate your store to. if this is an italian, the domain name can be yourdomainname-it.
then select the storefront language.
the currency the unit of measure - for some markets can be different once you click on ""next step"", you will see the line representing the language version you have created.
you should wait until the installation is completed. as soon as the installation is ready, hit the ""complete the configuration"" button, and you will be redirected to your brand new store in italian.
step 2 in the second step, you have to select the elements you want to be translated into the target language. 1.
the design - if you already have a template for your design or some custom code already applied to your main store, it is good to copy the design.
so enabling this option means that the design of your original store will be copied to your new language version.
there is no automatic translation option in the design since no content can be translated in most cases.
and in cases where it can be translated, we prefer to not make changes to html or css codes for security reasons. 2.
the menu - if you switch it on, the header and footer menus will be copied from your original store to the new language version.
you can also put a tick on ai translation if you want the menus to be automatically translated. 3. the blog - with this option, you can easily copy all your blog categories and articles.
they can also be translated into the targeted language. 4. the pages - enable the option to copy pages of your store.
if you check the box, all pages that are not created with the visual drag-and-drop builder will be translated into the target language. the rest will not be translated automatically. 5.
the products - if the option is switched on, the entire product catalogue will be copied to your new language version from your main store. step 3 1.
next, you can select the exact product elements you want to be translated: 2. set the product price for your new language version.
in the first field, you can enter a multiplier to change prices for the market you will sell. e.g., if a product costs bgn 120 x 0.5 = bgn 180 or approximately eur 92.
in this way, you can play with prices for the various markets you are selling. in the second field, you have to set the price decimals.
this setting allows you to create marketing prices for your products. e.g., if the product price is eur 94.30, enter a value of 95 in the field, the product price would be 94.95.
step 4 in the fourth step, you have to choose the subscription plan for your new language version. choosing a subscription plan in this step will give you an additional discount on the prices.
below you will see recommended applications for your new language version store. one of these applications is cloudcart synchronizer.
with that app, you can synchronize product quantities to the language version store from the main store. see more information here.
the price app is also discounted if you install it on your new language version store.
step 5 confirmation of your order - the last step is to confirm your order and initiate payment for your chosen services.
tracking progress page - here, you can see the progress of different services. the translation process depends on the text volume that needs to be translated.
if there is too much text, the process could take a couple of hours in some cases.
once it is completed you will see the message: the language flags will appear in your admin panel when your store has been successfully configured. the flag shows the storefront language.
it does not matter what language you set for your admin panel at the moment, when you select a certain flag, it refers to the storefront language.
do not forget to check the translation of the elements you have chosen to be translated when it is ready.
keep in mind that texts that were different from the output language will not be translated into the target language.
for example, if in the product descriptions there is part of the text which is in english and your source language is german, then this part will not be translated into the target language.
additional settings when everything is set up and ready to use, you can see the information for your new language version store when you open the app.
if you click on the button shown in the photo above, you will open a side panel with additional settings: copy newly added products from your main store to the language version.
you can choose if you want these products to be translated and what elements to translate; what would be the approval method?
if you select approve automatically, you won't need to take action, and the system will copy the products from the main store to the respective store.
automatically delete products - if you enable the option, the products that have been deleted in the main store will be deleted in the language version as well.
this refers only to the products that are copied through the application. show language version on site - this setting refers to the language switcher on the storefront.
if you enable it customers will see small flags to change the language version.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000524994

conditions and settings of the forms,"pop-up form conditions and settings are an important part of creating and using forms, as this can set the conditions under which a form is shown to the customer and when it is not shown or hidden.
in this section: display form on start displaying stop displaying double opt-in to go to the settings panel click on the button ""show settings"" and a new window will open.
display form on in this section, you can choose which urls, your form to show to customers and which not.
if you do not add any urls, the form will be displayed on the entire website, ie on each page, and will be hidden when someone fills it out. 1.
the first option allows you to show the pop-up to all users, even those who have already subscribed. the cloudcart ai identifies each user, so it knows which user is a subscriber and who is not.
we recommend that you do not enable this option, but only show the pop-up form to ""new"" users who have not subscribed. 2.
in the fields shown on the image below, you can add the urls where you want the pop-up form to appear and where you don't. for example, if you want this to be your homepage, add the appropriate url.
you can add more than one url.
if you want to show the pop-up of all the pages of the categories, for example, you do not need to add their urls one by one, you can do so by putting an asterisk at the end of the url - https://yourdomain.com/category/*.
this will display a pop-up on all category pages. if you don't want to show pop-ups on the checkout or cart pages, then add their urls in the ""don't show on"" fields.
as mentioned above, if you do not add any urls, this means that the form will be displayed anywhere on your site.
start displaying in this section, select when your subscription/announcement form you want to start displaying. you have three options: immediately - this option is selected by default.
the form will be displayed as soon as the user is on the specified page on which the pop-up is selected to be displayed.
time on page - if you don't want the pop-up form to be displayed as soon as the user opens your web page, you can choose when to display it depending on the time spent by the user on the specified page.
exit intent - the pop-up will be displayed when the user tries to leave the page. stop displaying in this section, you can control when to stop displaying the pop-up form to the customer.
""stop displaying after closure"" means that the pop-up will not be displayed after the user has closed it.
there are two options here: stop displaying forever - the form will no longer be shown to this user.
stop displaying for a certain number of hours or days - this means that if the customer closes the form and goes to another page where the form should normally be displayed again, he will not see it.
this option is useful to avoid annoying some customers by seeing the same form repeatedly, within a short period of time.
double opt-in in the last section, you can choose whether to verify the subscribed users or not.
if you don't want to verify users and select the first option it means that all subscribed users would skip the verification process.
keep in mind, that in that case, you cannot be sure that the email addresses users enter are real and valid.
if you choose to send a validation email link to every new subscriber, you can also edit the email template.
if you want to check that your settings are correct and the pop-up form is displayed according to the settings, you can do so in incognito mode on your browser by opening one of the urls you set to display it.

subscriber and device identification,"ai tool for identifying each person what distinguishes cloudcart campaigns from other marketing automation platforms is the ability to identify not just devices or sessions, but real people.
thanks to the ai tool and complex algorithms, cloudcart campaigns can define various profiles, subscribers and devices and bring them together into the so-called persona.
this will shorten your segmentation lists. you will no longer send the same message repeatedly to someone. this is crucial for good communication with your potential and current customers.
your campaigns will be better targeted and effective without unnecessary spam. what is a persona, and how is it identified by a cloudcart ai tool?
in online commerce, a ""persona"" is a real person who can use different devices, have different profiles, data, etc. the persona is neither a device nor a session, email or a specific customer record.
to identify a persona, cloudcart algorithms consider users' behaviour and all the information collected is combined to create that persona.
some of the key elements that are taken into account when identifying a persona are: email address- the email address is a universal user id.
however, users often use more than one email when logging into different sites. cloudcart takes into account all the information available to that user and subsequently identifies it as a personа.
phone number- this identifier is considered to be the most resistant as users usually do not often change their phone numbers.
uuid (unique user id) - when a user has opened a cloudcart store, our infrastructure gives him a unique id based on his device. this identifier does not change.
it includes information about the browser, processor, manufacturer, and model and some additional identifiers on the device itself.
those uuids are recorded into the browser as a cookie but also at the local storage of the browser. so even if the user deletes the cookie, we can still be able to identify that device. url -
the connection between all these three different points. the link we consider may be the one that the customer followed in an email or viber message you sent him.
all events listed are traced and united in one person. as soon as cloudcart campaigns are up and running on your website, it has that algorithm for identifying personae.
once you have this valuable information and can identify any user, the spam you send will be minimized. this is crucial for your company's reputation and communication with your customers.
thus, if a user performs a certain action as a purchase or viewing of products on your site from his business computer, then from his personal laptop or phone, it will be identified as one persona and will not receive three identical emails as he would receive if you use another type of email marketing software instead of cloudcart campaigns.
an identified person may have or may be: 1. several devices 2. several subscribers 3.
several customers the user profile who is identified as a persona is updated with the latest email and phone number he has used. when sending campaigns, they are taken into account.

the important thing about this type of campaign is to create the message you want to send, select the date and time, and send it. there is no automation, rules or further actions here.
on the other hand, an automated campaign is a type of campaign in which you set up your goals and the steps that must be taken, as well as the different conditions between the individual steps.
the main difference between regular and automated campaigns is that there is an ongoing process in automated campaigns, which is triggered as soon as a user enters a specific segment.

in regular campaigns you can have only one step, only one action! while in automated campaigns you can set as many steps as you need. the execute action drop-down menu is frozen.
the action will be performed immediately.
from the action's type menu, choose one of the following: if you select an email, for example, as a channel for your campaign, you can also select an email template from the relevant button and send it to your subscribers.
email templates there are 50+ themes, sorted into various categories, which you can choose from: there is also an option for saved templates.

variables legend to personalise your templates, use variables from the variables legend you can find at the bottom of the screen.
copy the content in quotation marks of the desired variable and place it wherever you want in the template.
when you send the email, all the variables you have used will be replaced by their real values.
for example, {$customer_first_name} will be replaced with the actual user name to whom you sent the email. you can also access variables from merge tags and import them directly: important!

customer tags in this section, you can select customer tags for those who exit the campaign successfully.
this means that if the action step is completed (in our case, the subscriber has received the email), then he will receive a tag.
the tag could be the name of the campaign or something else that serves as a reference. later you can use that information for future segmentation.
exit campaign this section is related to the conditions for ending the campaign in relation to the subscriber actions this is not the case with regular campaigns, as they do not have a choice of different actions.
this is a one-time campaign that is sent to the client and there are no different conditions and steps. so, there is no need to choose anything here.
once you are ready with the settings of your campaign, hit the save button. you should also click the start button; otherwise, the campaign will remain a draft, and it won't be activated.

automated campaigns,"
in this section: creating an automated campaign campaign's main settings campaign's triggers campaign actions email templates viber message customer tagging exit campaign campaign metrics unlike regular campaigns, which are one-step campaigns with one action, automated campaigns have triggers and based on that triggers the campaign is initiate.
a trigger could be that somebody has enter a specific segment and based on that action the campaign is launched.
the other difference is that automated campaigns could have multiple actions and various conditions between these actions.
creating an automated campaign to create your first automated campaign, go to your administration panel, marketing >
campaigns section, select campaigns from the menu, and click the create campaign button in the upper right corner of the screen. select the automated campaign tab > create a campaign.
in the window that opens, you'll see the steps you should take to set up your campaign. there are also several predefined best practisies you can choose from.
they will be available in your admin panel soon and the list will expand constantly!
campaign's main settings in the first section, you need to give your campaign a clear title so you can easily find it on your campaign list later.
the name is for internal use, only for your reference.
repeat the campaign for customers that got into it more than once - if this option is disabled, that campaign will initiate only once per customer.
if a customer enters the segment multiple times for some reason, that option will prevent the campaign from being resubmitted.
but if you want to notify your customers, every time someone enters the segment you have chosen, turn on this option, and the campaign will be sent every time.
execute campaign for existing subscribers in the segment - if you enable this option, your campaign will be sent to existing subscribers in the segment.
i.e, if you create a segment and that segment immediately includes 100 subscribers from your store, then if this option is turned off, they will not be reached by this campaign.
if you want it to be sent to all - existing subscribers and to those who will later enter the segment, leave the option on. by default, it is enabled.
campaign's triggers the campaign's triggers work exclusively with segments. as a condition for starting the campaign, you can choose whether the subscriber ""gets in"" or ""gets out"" of a segment.
if you choose ""gets in a segment"" and select the segment from the drop-down menu, then you will see the current customer number that meets these criteria.
if you don't find a segment relevant to your campaign, you can create a new one from the ""add segment"" button and then select it.
campaign actions with automated campaigns, we can have numerous steps with multiple-step actions and step conditions, unlike regular campaigns.
step action could be sending a viber, an sms, an email or a web push notification, changing a customer group, or setting tags. actions are related to some actions that are in the campaign.
step conditions are based on the step actions you will create. if you have selected ""sending an email"" as an action, the condition could be whether the email is open or not.
if it is open you can set a specific action to be performed, if the subscriber has not opened his email for several days, you can set another action to be performed.
the step action can be executed immediately or after a specific time when a user enters the segment related to this campaign.
as soon as the campaign is initiated for the particular persona, then after one hour, i.e., this action will be completed. after determining the execution time, you must also select the action type.
in the drop-down menu, you will see all the channels you have activated from the channels menu. in our case, we will select an email as an action type.
then we have to choose a template from our rich database or choose from the already saved templates we have.
email templates there are 50+ themes, sorted into various categories, which you can choose from: once you select the desired template, an easy to use drag-and-drop builder will open in a side panel where you can edit the template according to your taste and business needs.
the template's name is only for internal use.
the subject - the subject will be seen by the recipient, so be careful what you will type here because it is one of the most critical things regarding the open rate metrics.
your subject needs to be eye-catching so that the maximum number of subscribers can open your email. you can delete or add more sections to your template.
basically, you are able to change every element of the template. you can duplicate sections as well. there are multiple editing options: change the text, the colour, the line height, etc.
adding products - add the desired number of blocks and then add the content by dragging it from the right. drag the ""product"" icon to the box where you want to upload a product.
the product module works directly with your product inventory. so based on the trigger or your selection you can send it to your cusomers. select a product from your store.
you can select a triggered product that is connected somehow with the conditions from the segment you have set.
i.e, if somebody has been watching or browsing a product more than 3 times and you made a segment based on that criteria
and you have chosen that specific segment as a condition in your campaign, then you can get that triggered product directly in the template and give a customer a discount for the product he watched several times.
triggered product automation works directly with the segments. it will help you reach your customers with the right products, depending on what they've been looking for and browsing in your store.
the combinations can be thousands, but thanks to automation you will reach all customers with the relevant message. in the title box, you should enter the title of your message.
ex, ""get those products with 10% discounts"".
you can also choose how many products to show per row: you can change their names, show or hide the price, change the colours, and font sizes, change the text of the ""action"" button, choose whether to open the link in a new tab or not and much more.
if in the above step you have chosen to show, let's say, four triggered products in a row, but according to the customer's actions there are two products that meet the set criteria, then only these two products will be shown in the email.
keep in mind that, triggered products will be shown to you as an option to choose only if you have set segment related to products.
if the segments you have created don't contain anything about products you won't see that option in the email template at all.
variables legend to personalise your templates, use variables from the variables legend you can find at the bottom of the screen.
copy the content in quotation marks of the desired variable and place it wherever you want in the template.
when you send the email, all the variables you have used will be replaced by their real values.
for example, {$customer_first_name} will be replaced with the actual user name to whom you sent the email. you can also access variables from merge tags and import them directly: important!
use only variables that are indicated in the legend of variables. once you are ready with the template, save that step to move forward.
you can edit the template again later, but if you want to make some significant changes like action's type, note that all subsequent steps you create will be removed.
the next action could be a step or a condition: let's take ""conditions"". as we mentioned above, conditions are related to the previous step action.
in our case, the previous step action is an email, so the conditions could be: if the link has been clicked if the message has been read whatever you choose, the system will automatically generate the opposite of this condition: from the drop-down menus, you can select when the system will check if the message has been read.
this can be hours, days, weeks, months or immediately. in the picture above, if a customer has been read or has not been read for 4 days the email he will be sent immediately to the next step.
in the last drop-down menu, choose what to do next: you can choose a different follow-up for both read and unread messages: you can also seg tags to the customers.
i.e, if somebody didn't read the email, you can tag them and use that information for future segmentation: viber message the next step could be sending a viber message: viber messages could be more effective than emails, as customers check viber more often than checking their email.
internal title - only for your reference viber message text - place your message here using variables. to use them, just copy the content in the curly brackets and also the brackets themselves.
if you've created all the steps and conditions, you can continue with the 4th step of setting up your campaign.
customer tagging in this section, you can select customer tags for those who exit the campaign successfully.
this means that if the action steps are completed, the subscriber has passed all the steps or placed an order, then he will receive a tag.
the tag could be the name of the campaign or something else that serves as a reference. later you can use that information for future segmentation.
exit campaign the subscriber will exit the campaign when he places an order.
once you are ready with the settings of your campaign, hit the start button; otherwise, if you click only on the save button, the campaign will remain a draft, and it won't be activated.
keep in mind that as soon as you launch the campaign you won't be able to change anything afterwards. so make sure you have set everythig as you want before you start it.
campaign metrics the little green pulsating icon shown in the picture below shows that this is an automated campaign. the green colour means that the campaign is live, it is ongoing.
when becomes grey means that it has stopped.
information about the date added how many goals and steps does the campaign has reached subscribers placed orders - only completed and paid orders have been counted total revenue from that campaign from the ""statistics"" button, you can access the statistics page with all the information.

create a campaign to collect a customer rating for the last order placed,"
in this section: create a suitable segment set a campaign 1-st step 2-nd step 3-rd step 4-th and 5-th steps to create a campaign to get customers to leave reviews for purchased products, first install the ""product reviews"" app from your store's admin panel, section apps > all apps.
more information on how to make the relevant settings can be found here. create a suitable segment before creating a feedback campaign, you need to go to the marketing >
campaigns > segments section and create a segment from the ""add segment"" button in the upper right corner of your screen.
the segment should look like this: subscriber -> order -> where order is last-> order fulfillment status is fulfilled -> without product review.
thus, your campaign will reach only the ""right"" customers - every customer with his latest order, which fulfillment status is ""sent"" and there is no product review left yet.
set a campaign once you've already created a segment, go to the campaigns section and press the ""create campaign"" button in the upper right corner of the screen.
to collect ratings for your products, you need to create an automated campaign.
unlike regular campaigns, which are one-step campaigns with one action, automated campaigns have triggers and based on those triggers the campaign is initiated.
a trigger could be that somebody has entered a specific segment and based on that action the campaign is launched.
you can customize your campaign and create your own automation or use predefined templates. 1-st step first, enter the name of your campaign so you can distinguish it more easily.
the campaign name you choose is for internal use and your reference.
in this section, you can choose whether the campaign will be repeated for customers who have fallen into it more than once, as well as if it should be executed for already existing customers in the segment.
repeat the campaign for customers that got into it more than once - if this option is disabled, the campaign will start just once for customers in a given segment.
if a customer enters and exits from the segment multiple times (for example, every time he places an order that is shipped), this option will not allow the campaign to be resubmitted.
but if want to notify your customers every time someone falls into the given segment (places an order, in this case), turn on this option, and the campaign will be sent every time.
execute campaign for existing subscribers in segment - if you enable this option, your campaign will be sent to the existing subscribers in the segment.
that is, if when creating a segment, 100 subscribers from your store are automatically reached, they will not be reached by this campaign if you turn off this option.
if you want it to be sent to everyone - existing subscribers and those who will later join the segment, leave the option on. it is enabled by default.
2-nd step in the second step, select ""gets in segment"" and select the segment from the drop-down menu, then, you will see the current number of customers that meet these criteria.
this way, every time a customer falls into the selected segment, the campaign will start automatically.
if you do not find a segment suitable for your campaign, you can create a new one from the ""add segment"" button and then select it.
3-rd step in the ""campaign actions"" section, you must build your campaign logic. with each step, a given action is executed and could have its own conditions.
the action type can be send a message - viber, sms, email or web push notification, set a customer group or tags. the conditions are based on the steps you will create.
if you have selected ""send email"" as the action, the condition may be if the email is opened or not.
if the customer has opened the email you sent him, you can set a specific action to be executed after that.
if the subscriber hasn't opened its email in a few days, you can set another action to be executed given that.
the action can be executed immediately or after a specified time after the user has landed in the segment related to the campaign you are creating.
in the ""action's type"" drop-down menu, you will see all channels you have enabled in the channels section.
in our case, we will select email as action's type, 7 days after a customer has fallen into the segment (i.e. after days after his order has been paid).
then you need to choose a template from our extensive database to use for the campaign, select from the already saved templates you have or create a completely new one.
in our case, we will select one of the ready-made templates from our database.
each template can be edited according to your taste and business needs with our easy-to-use drag-and-drop visual builder. the template's name is only for internal use.
the subject - the subject will be seen by the recipient, so be careful what you will type here because it is one of the most critical things regarding the open rate metrics.
your subject needs to be eye-catching so that the maximum number of subscribers can open your email. you can delete or add more sections to your template.
basically, you can change every element of the template variables legend - to personalise your templates, use variables from the variables legend you can find at the bottom of the screen.
copy the content in quotation marks of the desired variable and place it wherever you want in the template.
when you send the email, all the variables you have used will be replaced by their real values.
for example, {$customer_first_name} will be replaced with the actual user name to whom you sent the email.
you can also access variables from merge tags and import them directly: do not forget that some of the variables turn into links, for example, {$products_leave_feedback_url} is a link, which would not look good in an email.
that is why you can make it a hyperlink to a text, a link to a button or picture. once you are done editing the template, save the step to continue.
once you have saved step 1, you can create a condition for it or go directly to step two. we will go to the second step, which will send a follow-up email in another three days.
4-th and 5-th steps the last two steps are optional for this type of campaign and can be omitted.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000532381

promote sales with triggered products,"with triggered products user communication with the online store is much more contextual.
for example, a customer browses your store and based on that behavior you can build a segment with conditions.
and if your conditions are related with products, you can use this segment to create a campaign that is related to triggered products.
an example of that are all customers who view products in the ball category over a period of time. they can receive a message based on their actions.
you can send them three or four products from that category at a discount and thus communicate with your customers in a whole new way, which is very relevant for their actions and urges them to make a purchase.
in this section: create a trigger/segment prepare a campaign with triggered products create a trigger/segment the trigger is the segment itself. we use segments to trigger a campaign.
the segment consists of conditions and when one of our visitors successfully enters or exits this particular segment, this is called an event. the event triggers the campaign.
go to the admin panel of your online store, marketing > campaigns > segments section and create a new segment from the add segment button.
let's see which conditions are appropriate for ""unlocking"" the triggered products. first of all, this is the ""order"" condition.
after selecting it you need to select a sub-condition related to it, for example, ""average order value"", ""date"" or ""amount"". even ""products"" related with a given order ""unlock"" triggered products.
for example: subscriber -> order -> order average more than 50 eur. the second major condition that ""unlocks"" the triggered products is ""cart"" as well as all its sub-conditions.
we will use the segment below when we create the campaign. subscriber -> cart -> cart amount more than 1 eur.
other unlocking conditions are: ""subscribed for product availability, and which are already available"" ""membership"" ""product reviews"" ""wishlist"" ""view"" your conditions must be related to the products in some way.
prepare a campaign with triggered products 1. once you have created a segment, go to the campaigns section and create an automated campaign from the create campaign button in the upper right corner.
for more information on automated campaigns see here. 2. first, name the campaign. the name is for internal use only.

in the second step, select ""gets in segment"" and select the segment from the drop-down menu after which the number of subscribers in the segment will be displayed. 4.
when building the logic of your campaign in section three the action's type can be sending a message, email, sms, viber or web push notification, setting a customer group or tags.
in this case we will select email as an action's type, immediately after a customer has entered the segment. 5.
then you need to choose a template from our vast database, to use one you have saved or a brand new one.
for convenience, here we will select a new blank template and with a drag-and-drop of the mouse using the product widget we will place a product in the email body.
when you click on the product itself on the right open up menus, one of which gives you access to the triggered products which are associated with a specific campaign you have started.
this means that the products that are in the cart will be transferred to the message and the message will be contextual.
so that each customer who has in their cart more than one eur will receive a contextual message with products based on the products which are already in their cart.
and from here you can build your contextual email with specific products.
you can also offer a dynamic discount code, of course you will have to fill in the parameters that the system will require from you: the purpose of triggered products is to provide a contextual and personalized attitude towards each individual visitor of your online store.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000533320

general information on basic metrics,...,https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000521175
how to boost your sales using rfm analysis?,"rfm stands for recency, frequency and monetary value.
the rfm model is based on three key factors: 1. how recently a customer has made a purchase from a brand; 2. how frequently he has engaged with a brand; 3. how much money he has spent on its products and services.
with rfm analysis, marketers increase their revenue by targeting specific groups of existing customers with messages and offers that are more likely to be appropriate based on data for a specific set of behaviors.
rfm analysis has a number of benefits for your business including increased response rate, customer retention, customer satisfaction and increased sales.
in this section: characteristics of individual groups churned customers new customers potential customers occasional customers
loyal customers active loyal customers champions statistics label in the subscriber section creating segments the rfm analysis tool, part of the cloudcart marketing suite is enabled only for enterprise- and enterprise plus-level merchants.
this functionality is located on the marketing suite dashboard and divides the customer base into 16 different groups, as shown below.
the diagram includes only customers who have made at least one purchase. the 'recency' factor is plotted horizontally, the 'frequency' - vertically and 'the monetary value' - diagonally.
based on these three metrics, complicated calculations are made and based on them, depending on the selected period, the different groups are formed.
all groups are colored differently to organize and visualize them better.
the groups with good indicators are in blue-green color and those in yellow-orange refer to segments that tend not to perform well.
characteristics of individual groups churned customers churned - in the lower left corner is located the group of customers with the lowest indicators, colored orange.
most users will be in this group. it includes customers who have placed only one order in the past but have not returned since.
churned loyal - the group is colored light orange and sits right above the churned one.
it includes people who have made purchases in the past within the selected period, in this case, in the last 90 days. they have not made any purchases recently, but they used to be loyal.
knowing who these customers are is good for making the necessary efforts to win them back. churned loyal high-spender - this group sits above churned loyal and is colored light orange.
customers in it have made purchases in the past, they have not only been loyal at the beginning of the period but have spent a considerable amount - more than the regular consumer.
but they have bought nothing recently, and you cannot expect orders from them if you do not make some effort to reengage them.
churned high-spender - the group is positioned to the right of churned on the diagram and has a light orange background.
customers in this group are not loyal, shopped sporadically in the past but spent a lot.
to win back churned customers, focus your efforts first on churned loyal high-spenders, then on churned high-spenders and finally on churned loyals.
the churned group does not have serious potential to restore customer interest, as they have made only one purchase, and a long time ago.
the period you set for rfm analysis from the marketing > campaigns > subscribers > settings menu needs to be tailored to your market niche.
for cosmetics, for example, the appropriate period is between 3 and 6 months, for groceries - 60 days, and for electronics - 360 days.
after changing the period from the respective field you need to wait at least 24 hours to receive up-to-date statistical data.
new customers new - this group is colored yellow and includes customers who have recently made purchases but have ordered nothing in the past. new high-spender - the group is colored yellow.
it consists of customers who have shopped recently and have spent more than the average order value. it is worth investing effort to make these customers loyal.
potential customers potential - the group is colored purple.
it includes customers who were new until recently but have made more orders and have the potential to become champs, active loyals or loyals. you need to focus your efforts on this group.
potential high-spender - the group is purple and consists of customers who have not only made more orders than a new customer but have spent more than the average order value.
customers in this group have the potential to become champs, active loyal high-spenders or loyal high-spenders. active potential - the group is colored purple.
here are included customers with potential who have recently made an order - in the last few days. they can become champions, active loyals or loyals.

with multiple filtering options, saving predefined filters, visualization as separate sections and quick order overview, the need for staff to process orders is reduced by up to 5 times.
thus, in practice, we calculated that a well-trained operator can process an average of about 200 orders per day.
this saves you on hiring costs, increases your productivity and ensures that your customers will always be able to receive their orders on time.
and that, in turn, means more satisfied customers and more revenue for your business. learn more about managing orders from the video below:",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000513332
order processing,"
order processing generating a waybill, issuing an invoice, printing a pick-up list, sending a transactional email to the customer with a link to track the shipment, attaching a pdf invoice in an email boil down to pressing a button.
information about the customer's location, the group he belongs to, the turnover he has generated and the total number of orders he has made in your store allows you to assess and prioritize your tasks at a glance replacing products, adding discounts or removing a product from an already created order is easy.
learn more about replacing products and adding discounts here: the cloudcart system divides an order into three types of statuses - fulfillment status, payment status and general order status, which is derived from the previous two.
through this division, you and your customers will be aware of what phase each order is in and you will be able to prioritize your daily tasks.
and because we know that each business is individual and has its own individual needs, we have created a feature that allows you to add or rename the existing payment, fulfillment and global order statuses so that they fit your needs in the processing process of orders.
learn more about the different types of statuses here: in addition to all this, the system comes with built-in automation for certain order statuses.
for example, if the order has a waybill generated, its status will automatically change to fulfilled, which in turn will trigger an automation to send email notifications, send a webhook event to third party software, display the available quantity of each of the ordered products, etc.
another such automation allows when an order is sent upon receipt of payment, the order to be automatically marked as completed, to send an email to the customer, etc. learn more about automation for order statuses here: changing the method of payment, the shipping method and even the shipping address of an order is done by pressing a few buttons.
learn more about making changes to payment and shipping methods here: the order processing system monitors the actions of the operator in real time and does not allow its processing by a second operator.
this ensures that one order will never be processed by two operators at the same time.
learn more about the order processing system here: through the built-in identification by utm tags and geolocation of each user, there is a section that provides information about the source of the order, as well as the actual ip address of the customer.
if there is a discrepancy between the shipping address and the customer's ip address, the system will notify you to be careful when sending this order.
in addition, it will inform you from which advertising campaign or google search the order was generated.
learn more about available source information here: the order processing system also comes with a built-in action tracking system, recording each action of each of your employees, displaying information about each change and its previous values.
learn more about the action tracking system here: export all the information about the orders placed on your site in a convenient for work and analysis csv file, which you will be able to open with excel.

managing ordered products,"ordered products because cloudcart is a platform that serves large online businesses, we need to maintain standards appropriate for large online merchants.
one of these professional features is ordered products. with this functionality, the operators who work on dipping the products are greatly facilitated.
the system groups one product and displays information about the total number needed to fulfill all orders of the day, information about the supplier, the supplier price, as well as its identifier.
in addition, the system allows the printing of a pickup sheet to be used when working in a warehouse.
for example, if today you have 50 оrders and instead of opening order by order and taking out the ordered products from each one, this section allows you to see that product x has been ordered 12 times and you need 18 pcs.
and from product y it has been ordered 2 times and you need 24 pieces of it. learn more about ordered products from the video below:",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000513348

discounts,"discounts there are 9 basic methods for creating discounts, and in combination with all their options you get hundreds of options for creating discounts.
in the general case, we have divided the discounts into two main sections - discounts on the product catalog and discounts to the total in the cart.
learn more about discounts here: discounts on the product catalog discount - this is how we named the most used method for creating a discount, because it is universal and at the same time allows you to create discounts on multiple products without having to edit product by product.
this method combines the two main cases and it is possible to create discounts for both the product catalog and the cart.
you can create a price discount with a percentage or a fixed amount or even free shipping by applying these discounts to orders over a certain amount, products from a specific category (s), vendors / brands, collections or specific products.
the method makes it possible to fix dates of activity of the promotion, specific user groups, global or personal restrictions on the number of uses of the discount.
learn more about the global discount here: fixed discount - when you need to define a discount for a specific product or even a specific variant of product, this is the discount you need.
it is important to say that this discount uses a specific price of a product and does not allow the introduction of %.
learn more about the fixed discount here: buy x get y - one of the most incentive discounts for purchases. this discount increases the aov (average order value) indicator.
in combination with a countdown discount, a double-digit percentage rate of conversion is achieved. learn more about the buy-x-get-y discount here: quantity discount - when buying 1 pc.
the price is bgn x, when buying 3 pcs. - y bgn, etc. this discount also helps to increase the aov.
learn more about the quantity discount here: discounts to the total in the cart discount with a promo code -
this discount method allows you to offer your customers promo codes to apply to their shopping cart. these promo codes apply to the entire value of the cart.
here again we have the opportunity to define the type of discount by percentage, fixed amount or free shipping and the opportunity to define the discount to specific products or categories, collections, brands of products.
one of the most used conditions for applying the discount is orders over a certain amount.
this method has an ean-13 and ean-8 algorithm, through which you can validate the entered codes from customer cards. user / membership cards with ean algorithm -
this is an innovative feature that aims to reduce the time and cost of creating and printing promo codes.
if your business works with membership / user cards and already has distributed them, most of them have numbers. these numbers are mostly generated using the ean-13 or ean-8 algorithm.
using the built-in validation method of ean-13 and ean-8, your store is able to validate the correctness of the entered code on the card.
in this way you can reuse the distributed user cards and at the same time offer your loyal customers personal discounts through their cards.
learn more about discounts with a promo code here: countdown discount - this discount fights directly against cart abandonment by aiming to engage users with a discount as soon as the checkout process starts.
the principle of operation is to apply a discount in advance (according to the set criteria and conditions) and if the order is completed within the set time, the discount remains active.
to enhance the effect of urgency, the discount also shows a countdown timer.
learn more about the countdown discount here: discount with multiple promo codes - this type of discount is a dream tool for campaigns with a longer duration.
the principle of this discount is to encourage consumers to collect promo codes that they can use together or separately in their orders.
example: for each order in a period of time and over a certain amount to receive a promo code for 10%.
when ordering, they will be able to use the collected percentages but not more than 50% of the value of their order. learn more about discounts with multiple promo codes here:",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000513351
bumpcart,"bumpcart with this app, it is possible to increase the aov (average order value).
the app aims to understand the goal of the merchant and on this basis to offer products that will fill the price of the order until the goal is reached.
the goals of the app can be free shipping for amounts above a certain value, a discount when a certain value is reached, a minimum order price or a goal to increase aov.
the app has the ability to display products based on categories, vendors, specific products and similar products. learn more about bumpcart from the video below:",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000513930
seo,"
every online store created on cloudcart has something that cannot be seen at first glance, but in the long run, it is very likely to return the investment by contributing to excellent results in organic traffic.
the section is intended for people with knowledge of seo and it is recommended not to use it if you do not know what it is.
cloudcart is perfectly set up for any online store and does not need to be further adjusted. if your requirements are more specific, then we will be happy if the tools we provide are useful to you.
with the provision of many seo tools, excellent semantic structure, content optimization and much more, cloudcart is not only seo firendly but is also a system that is optimized by leading experts in the field.
in this section: robots.txt management xml sitemap address canonicity de-indexing filters 301 redirects server side rendering structural data in json-ld format metadata management content management when sharing rss feed learn more about available seo tools from the video below: robots.txt management one of the leading saas platforms, shopify, recently announced that it is now possible for its users to edit this file.
in cloudcart, this opportunity was set during the development of the platform because we knew that it would be important for our users to determine what is important for their business to crawl.
learn more about the management of the robots.txt file here: xml sitemap when cloudcart's xml sitemap structure was first announced, many industry experts thought it was incorrect.
our innovative approaches sometimes cause misunderstanding, but this is the strength of cloudcart - to create trends. the xml sitemap generator is no exception.
the goal is to create a light and at the same time clear organization even with a huge product catalog. we achieve this by creating multiple small sitemaps that merge into a single sitemap.xml file.
in this way, we are able to deliver all content to google in a structured way without forcing it to spend more on structuring resources.
the result is up to five times more frequent reading of these sitemaps, which in turn ensures faster crawling of the online store.
learn more about xml sitemap here: address canonicity when using cloudcart, you don't have to worry about duplicate content.
cloudcart algorithms create canonical tags to define the main page that needs to be indexed, and all its derivatives are marked as such.
this directs the indexing machines to focus their resources there. this structure ensures that only important pages in the store are indexed correctly.
such functionality is difficult to implement by developers without guidance from an seo specialist and competing stores without such a structure have no chance in front of any cloudcart store.
learn more about address canonicity here: de-indexing filters if you're working with tens of thousands of products, your store probably has dozens of filtering, sorting, and paging tools.
this creates a huge database of links that need to be crawled. this in turn increases the time and resources required and worsens the results in the serp.
it is for this reason that we have created this professional tool through which it is possible to find the depth of indexing.
learn more about de-indexing filters here: 301 redirects without this tool, no self-respecting platform should enter the market.
through it, it is possible to preserve the established links between the site and external platforms, as well as to preserve the current positions in the serp.
in cloudcart, 301 redirects can be created in several ways - manually, via api or by import.
one of the hidden bonuses of the platform is that it automatically makes 301 redirects to each link that is changed by a user.
for example, if you change the link of a product and, as is often the case, forget to link from the old to the new, the system will do it automatically for you.
this ensures that you can't go wrong in managing the content of your business and seo processes are followed according to established standards.
learn more about 301 redirects here: server side rendering true to the innovative nature of the cloudcart system - we have created an environment that works with processed html pages to provide the content of crawling software in a ready-made, rendered html structure without having to wait for a database or external code to load.
in this way, the content is delivered several times faster, which guarantees faster indexing and a larger volume of indexed pages.
this technology of providing the content to indexing machines is innovative and is not offered by any of the current e-commerce platforms.
learn more about server side rendering here: structural data in json-ld format json-ld stands for javascript object notation for linked data, which consists of multidimensional arrays (example: a list of attribute-value pairs).
this is a data structuring implementation format analogous to microdata and rdf. google prefers json-ld structured data.
google's john mueller has made it clear that google prefers json-ld structured data. each page created in a cloudcart store has json-ld structured content information.
this allows crawlers to read the content and visualize it in google's serp.
learn more about the json-ld format here: metadata management in cloudcart it is possible to manage metadata on all pages, including those created through official channels.
from the product page to the thank you page when completing an order, each page has the option to create and edit metadata.
learn more about metadata management here: automated metadata management through seo spinner learn more here: content management when sharing we don't need to convince you that sharing content on social media is a must.
we also don't need to convince you that a good content presentation is extremely important for the visibility of your business.
that's why we've created a tool that lets you let your users share interesting content from your store.
we have also thought about the possibilities of determining the main image of your store when sharing on social networks.
learn more about managing content that gets shared here: rss feed through the built-in rss feed of information you can allow external systems to read the latest content of your store and this can be useful when retrieving information about email newsletters, syndicating with your partners and more.

how to write a blog post,"
table of contents irresistible headlines sub-headers the body captivating advice motivational closings musts for every blog post good practices for managing user engagement irresistible headlines the headline is the roadmap of the article.
so, always determine the title before writing the article, so the post does not go in multiple directions.
it is crucial that the title clearly identifies the topic, entices readers and leaves them impatient for your advice.
narrowing in on something specific makes readers feel like you have the exact answers they’re looking for. “how to” headlines are classic, and they work.
use specific numbers and data in your headline - it is an effective way to make your article more enticing to readers. headlines with numbers tend to generate more social shares and engagement. ex.
“7 woodworking projects and how to sell them online”, “the top 11 email marketing software for online stores” use mostly odd numbers in the title.
odd numbers help people digest and recall information more easily than even numbers. the length - the ideal blog post title length is 60 characters.
longer titles will be cut off in google sub-headers sub-headers are on-page seo elements that help the blog post to rank in google search.
sub-headers organize and break up your blog post into different sections to signal to google and readers what the post will cover.
sub-headers should be written with h2 tags or smaller -- never h1 tags, which signal a title. use sub-headers to split up different sections of your blog post.
make sure to integrate the keywords you're using this post to target. treat your subheads like mini-headlines and make sure they invoke curiosity, so readers don’t bounce.
each subhead should lead to the ultimate destination — what was promised by the headline. see the example below: the body the whole article should be divided into sections by sub-headers.
analyzes show that the ideal length of a blog post is approximately 2100 words, but this will vary depending on your topic.
posts that took seven minutes to read earned the most engagement and attention.
although, as long as your post is informative and as long as it answers your audience’s questions, it doesn’t matter how long it is.

it has been shown that numbers written as numerals (21) instead of words (twenty-one) attract the attention of readers as they quickly scan what they read online.
multimedia - to keep the reader focused on your post wherever it's possible use multimedia content to break up the blog post. add images, screenshots, videos, audio recordings.
include the right images - they should tell a story as much as the words do. visual elements will give additional value to your reader. add one relevant to the topic image right after the headline.
this will be the main image of your article. call to action buttons (cta) - finish your blog post with a meaningful call to action (cta) for your reader.
whether it's a content offer, button to some type of service or for registration, or a link to another related blog post.
leave the reader feeling like he learned something from you, and like there's, even more, to learn from you. create the desire to click a link or cta image and read more.
references to other articles and materials on the topic being written about - this will ensure intuitive navigation between relevant posts.

a change of the product page uniting all products,"what we are going to change?
a few months ago we told you that we will remove an obsolete and unused section in your online store, namely the page with all your products in one place, the address: https://mystore/products.
with this small change, we make it easier for search engines to understand your website more easily and not overload it by crawling it unnecessarily.
this way, search engines will focus on the really important pages on your site, and customers will get the best customer experience, which in turn will increase the chances of buying.
the change will not affect the visualization of the products in your store, on the contrary, the focus will be on the categories and collections you have created and the active use of different types of product filters, which allow consumers to narrow down their product choice according to their personal preferences.
what do you get? less busy and better working modern online store with perfectly optimized pages.
so far, the ”/products section” has indexed multiple pages with an equal weight of important urls (categories, manufacturers, collections, etc.), leading to their cannibalization, which is why we are removing this outdated path, which combines your products into one inefficient address.
these and other improvements we make will lead to better indexing of your store and more sales. what do you have to do?
if you use the url described above in your navigation menu, banners, sliders, images, text boxes, or in your ad campaign (social networking, google and email marketing), you can replace it with one of the following examples: change section products: you can replace the / products link with a new collection that brings together products from all your categories.
see the article in our help center where you can create your collections. change your products menu into a non-clickable button, expand the list of all categories, including your product catalog.
this would lead to greater control of the action by the customer. after the described change, your categories and collections will be significantly more clickable.

a change of product feed links,"as you know, we at cloudcart strive to constantly improve our products to grow together.
our system is constantly optimized with new, more efficient and improved functionalities with a higher degree of protection.
increasing the security of your online store is the basis of the work of our entire team.
if you are promoting your products through facebook and google and you have the facebook dynamic ads and/or google ads remarketing applications installed in your online store, it is good to be aware of the change we have made.
we have made changes to all feed links in cc store but the main places where you need to change it are fb dynamic ads and google ads.
in this article the focus is on what you need to do to change the links if you use these applications.
if you are not using either and have not created a facebook product catalog feed or merchant center feed, these changes do not apply to you and you do not need to do anything. facebook dynamic ads
this is an extremely useful marketing tool through which you can create dynamic product ads on facebook by creating a product catalog feed.
this is a file that contains information about each of the products you choose to advertise. each line of this file carries enough information to create a dynamic product ad on facebook.
when automatic update is set for a specific period, this file is generated dynamically, which means you don't have to upload it every time you make changes to your products.
in practice, the benefit for you is that if a customer enters the store and views or adds to the cart specific products without buying them, based on the pixel attached to your store facebook, this information is dynamically submitted to remarketing advertising with the product catalogue on facebook.
so while scrolling through the social network, the customer will see an ad with exactly those products that he liked and can return and complete his order.
google ads remarketing with the google ads remarketing app, you can create short text ads and display banners to reach web users.
ad serving is based on google keywords and cookies, which are used to calculate the relevancy of an ad to a search engine or to a specific site.
ads appear on official google sites and applications, as well as on google partner sites (via google adsense).
advertisers pay for an ad when users show interest and click on it to learn more, and google's partner sites receive a percentage of the cost per click.
once you have successfully set up google ads, you can create your product catalogue via the product feed link. what are we changing?
for greater protection and security, we have changed the generated product feed links that you put when setting up these and some other applications.
therefore, in case you use this type of links for your advertising campaigns, you need to replace them with the new unique links, which are automatically generated in the admin panel of your store. 1. for facebook, you can take it from the menu apps >
facebook dynamic ads and place it in the appropriate field ""feed url"" in the settings of your product catalogue in the facebook profile of your store. 2.
for google ads remarketing, from the menu in the admin panel, select apps > google ads remarketing. copy the new link and paste it in the appropriate field in your google ads account settings.
these and other improvements we make will lead to greater protection and security of the content in your online store. caution:
if you do not follow these steps, the old feed link will not work correctly. the amendment is effective from 10.10.2020.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000470615

а change in the way orders are numbered,"from 7.10.2021 a change in the logic for numbering orders in the databases of the stores comes into force. until now, order numbers (if digital numbering was chosen) followed absolute order.
driven by the desire to constantly optimize the process of shopping in stores we found that compliance with absolute sequence can lead to a delay in the process of completing an order.
sometimes it happens to complete hundreds of orders at once.
therefore, we changed the logical process and it is now possible that the numbering of orders is not in absolute order, i.e. to omit numbers.
if you think it's better for your business, you can use the string of numbers and letters setting found in settings > cart and checkout > processing orders.
why is the string of numbers and letters option useful: ensuring a good level of confidentiality in terms of the number of orders - inability of the competition to track the number of orders received in your store due to the removal of their absolute order.
for starters or merchants with fewer orders in their stores, the option of a string of letters and numbers when numbering orders is an effective way not to disclose information about the volume of your sales to customers.
this is all you need to know about the way orders are numbered.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000508995
dns change,"if your domain is directed via a record to ip 88.198.109.127 you will need to change this. in this section: how to check if there is a need for dns change?
option 1 option 2 option 3 how to check if there is a need for dns change?
if you have added your domain after august 1, 2021, you probably don't need to change anything, but it's still a good idea to check:
https://intodns.com/yourdomain at the bottom of the ""www"" section, look for ""www a record"", there should be your official domain in cloudcart of the type xxx.cloudcart.net.
the correct configuration would look like this: (the domain in the photo is an example, you must use yours)
if this is not the case, you need to go through one of the following options: referral to the cloudcart store must be via a cname record to your cloudcart business domain.
*you can see it in settings > domain first. option 1 go to the dns administration of your domain.
create a cname record from @ (root) to your cloudcart official domain, which should look like xxx.cloudcart.net. you can also add a cname to www. to the same or to @ (root).
look for a record to ip 88.198.109.127 and delete it. you should get: * administration of name.com 5. test it! *in some administrations it is not possible to create only a cname without an a record.
then you need to choose one of the following options. **in some administrations you may need to swap steps 2 and 3. ***you can ask the support team of the relevant administration for assistance.

when they show up, press continue. 5. in the next step, cloudflare instructs you to change your nameservers. this should happen where your domain was purchased. 6.
after changing ns you need to go back to your cloudflare account and remove a record to 88.198.109.127 7.

an overview and product catalog,"this article will go through some of the basic steps needed to create your online store.
log in as an administrator organize your product catalog adding product properties adding product variants adding vendors adding a product adding product options adding product bundles inventory section adding smart collections product statuses log in as an administrator go to the login page in your admin panel.
the login url is always your domain, followed by admin and login (yourdomainname.com/admin/login).
if you have not yet added a primary custom domain, your domain will be a cloudcart subdomain and will look like this - yourdomain.cloudcart.net/admin/login.
after you have entered your login details, you will see the main information page of the admin panel, which displays detailed information with data about your orders, sales, customers, and products.
the following information will be displayed: in the upper left corner, you will find the customer service center.
there is an indication of whether all systems are working in order, access to the status monitor, the help center and the ability to send a message to the support department.
in the upper right corner, you have statistics for new and abandoned orders, out-of-stock products and the total number of customers: new orders - here are visible all orders that are not marked as completed.
this means that they need to be monitored in order to take appropriate measures to be completed.
abandoned orders - sometimes customers who add something to their cart give up in the order process and do not complete it.
any order in which a potential customer provides his contact information but fails to complete it is considered an abandoned order in the cloudcart platform.
out-of-stock products - here you can track your product range and which products need to be supplied because your customers will not be able to buy them in case they are out of stock.
total customers - this is the total number of customers in the store. directly under the customer service center in the news feed are published current posts from our blog page.
to the news feed's right, you can filter your sales for a specific time period. through this section you find out how the sales in the store are going.
the charts are interactive - this means that you can click on selected dates, values, and categories to get more detailed information.
you can change the period for which information is provided selecting a range from the drop-down menu. this allows you to set a specific calendar period.
the release notes section displays all cloudcart software improvements in real-time. you have the option to suggest a new feature by pressing the red button.
the store performance section shows metrics related to your online store's performance - e.g. order income, average order value, etc. at the bottom right is a descending list of the best-selling products in your store.
having the opportunity to quickly review the best-selling products, you will be able to adequately plan your marketing strategies. clicking view report will display details for products.
organize your product catalog the first thing you need to do is create and organize your product catalog. start by creating categories to which you can later assign your products.
from the menu bar, go to the products > categories section. you can create parent categories and subcategories. see how to create categories in your store here.
when creating a category, be sure to define it. adding product properties the next step is to create properties for the main categories, as well as for the subcategories if any.
the properties carry information about the product (eg material: wood, glass, etc.). they are assigned to a category instead of the products themselves.
unlike the variants, the category property is not mandatory and they do not have to be selected by customers.
they simply characterize the product and are visualized in the filter of the product catalog.
through the properties, customers will be able to more easily and accurately filter the products in your store. find out more about how to add and manage product properties in your store here.
adding product variants by creating variants for your products, you enable the customer to make a choice in the detail page of the viewed product. variants determine the specific product.
when the product has variants, the customer is obligated to choose one of them. example of variant- color: green, blue; size: s, m, l, xl, etc.
the field of the variant can be different types - radio button, image sample, drop-down menu, color sample, 2d scheme, etc. here you can read more about how to add product variants to your store.
adding vendors adding vendors of the products in your store helps to better organize your product catalog.
information about the manufacturers of different products is important for customers when they make their choice of which products to buy.
in addition, by adding manufacturers, your customers will be able to easily filter and find the products they want. for more information, see our article about adding different vendors.
once you've created the categories, category properties, variants, and added vendors, you can move on to filling out your product catalog.
adding a product from the menu, products section > add product you can add your products. a product can be assigned to a parent category and to a subcategory.
/parent category: blouses; subcategory: men's t-shirts/ you can upload both physical and digital products. this article will give you more information on how to add products to your store.
here you can see how to upload 360-degree photos and videos in the detailed product page.
once you've added the product you can see how it looks like in the storefront by clicking on the button shown below in the photo.
if you want to upload a larger number of products at once, and you already have all the necessary information gathered in the so-called csv file, you can see how to easily import them into your store in the following article: importing products with a csv file adding product options product options add additional features to your products that customers can choose from.
product options can be applied to a specific product, category, or manufacturer.
the options your customer will be able to use are: - to enter their own text to the product - to upload a file that you will receive in the order - to choose an option from a drop-down menu - to choose an option from a radio button - to choose as many options as he wishes for example: you want to add an option to ""engrave text on a glass"" and charge the customer extra for this service.
the options can be mandatory or optional, depending on the setting you set. *adding product options requires installing an application in your admin panel.
learn more about how to create and manage product options.
adding product bundles creating product bundles is an extremely useful option through which you can offer your customers a bundle of two or more products that they will be able to buy at a discount price.
it is advisable to add an image that unites all the products so that the customer can get a clear idea of what the bundle contains and what he would buy.
bundles can be created with a certain period of activity in which they can be purchased. example of a product bundle: summer set - contains a hat, dress, beach bag.
see more about product bundles in the following articles: adding product bundles and how to visualize bundles?
inventory section in the inventory section, you can track inventory in order to avoid selling products that have run out of stock and adjust inventory levels for products.
you can easily make bulk changes and maintain products whose stocks are quickly depleted with a single click on the inventory page. find out more about inventory tracking and management here.
adding smart collections collections are the easiest way to combine different types of products into one common group. you can use them to create promotions.
so as not to enter the detailed page of each product and change its characteristics, you have the opportunity to group different products in separate collections according to various criteria: by category, by tags, by discount / promotion, vendor, price, etc.
for detailed information about the collections, see the following article - adding product smart collections.
product statuses each product in your cloudcart store has a certain status - in stock / out of stock / coming soon, etc.
product statuses are extremely useful, as they give consumers the necessary information about the products you offer in your store and thus encourage them to perform a certain action.
you can set different statuses for each product according to its quantity or for all products globally.
statuses determine whether a product can be purchased by the customer or, if it is out of stock, make an inquiry to you. find out more about product statuses here.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000499434
initial store settings,"
in this section: payment methods shipping taxes adding an existing domain once you have built your product catalog the way you want it to be, it's time to move on to some of the main settings of your store - payments, shipping, set up taxes and more.
payment methods in order to receive payments for the goods purchased by your customers, you must configure at least one payment method.
go to settings > payments and select the payment method you want to configure. to enable cash on delivery, for example, click the configure button.
the name and logo of each payment method can be changed. another payment method you can activate is bank transfer.
with this payment method, after the customer completes his order, he receives your bank details so that he can order the corresponding amount he owes.
in addition to cash on delivery and bank transfer, you can integrate dozens of virtual pos terminals, well-known payment services such as braintree, stripe, paypal, everypay, mollie, and others.
learn more about how to set up each payment method in your store in the payments section of our help center.
shipping another important part of setting up your store is configuring shipping method (s).
in the section settings > shipping, you can add three types of custom delivery - depending on the weight of the order, depending on the price of the order, and depending on the weight and price and set different price conditions.
in addition, you can take advantage of the already built integrations that cloudcart has with various courier companies and create bills of lading for your shipments with just a few clicks directly from the admin panel of your store.
to do this, you need to install the appropriate applications in your store.
find out more about all of the shipping methods that you can configure in your store in the shipping section of our help center.
taxes understanding taxes is an essential part of running your business. as an online merchant, you are required to collect sales tax on orders where it is applicable.
therefore, you need to know when to include an additional tax on the products you are selling and when not. in your cloudcart store, you can create different taxes and apply them when needed.
taxes vary from country to country, so it is important to familiarize yourself with local laws.
when you set your tax rates, make sure that they are current and correct for the circumstances you apply them. when it is requisite, you can override or exempt taxes.
from the settings > taxes section you can set different fees and taxes.
you can enable or disable the option ""prices include taxes"" depending on the price of your products includes or does not include tax.
you can set different taxes and fees depending on the region and choose when to calculate tax - before or after shipping costs. you can also set exceptions by product categories and many more.
see all about the taxes in our help center. adding an existing domain adding your own domain or buying one if you still don't have, can be done in the settings section > domains.
there, you will see the cloudcart subdomain with which you registered your store and with which it loads both the customer part of your store and your control panel.
you have two options (buttons located at the top right of your screen) - to buy a new domain or add an existing one.
more information about the two options can be found in the following articles - how can i add an existing domain to my online store? and how to purchase a domain name from cloudcart?",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000501120
basic store settings,"in this section: general settings cart and checkout settings how to create an email account with your domain name? how to set up the local pickup app?
geo zones and geo polygons statuses translations administrators some of the settings we will go through in this article are: cart & checkout settings, how to set up your own email, how to create different geo zones and polygons and make your settings according to them, how to add your physical stores and enable the local pickup option and many others.
general settings the section is located in settings > general settings. in this part, you can change the logo of your store, the logo of the invoice, and the logo of the email.
you can also change the favicon of your store (the icon in the tab of each store).
in the standards and formats section, you can change the language of your admin panel, of the customer part of the store.
you can also change the currency, and all prices you enter will be displayed in the selected currency. you can also choose from different units of measure.
if you want to have different language versions of your store, you can use the multilingual store app.
for each language version you have a separate control panel, as your main store is duplicated in the desired language and an additional subdomain is created.
this way, your customers will be able to switch from one language version to another with just one button (flag or other).
you will be able to target your products of the different stores in different ways depending on the market. you can automatically sync products and stocks in your individual stores.
see more information for an additional language version here.

how to create an email account with your domain name? to build your business identity, you need to consider the email address from which you contact your customers and partners.
the benefits of creating an email account (mailbox) for your domain (s) are significant.
using a personalized email address increases customers' trust in you and your business, as well as the ability to establish your brand in the market.
having an email address with your domain name looks much more professional. sometimes the lack of one can make your business looks less serious than your competitors'.
when your domain name is present in every email you send, then you are constantly marketing your brand and building your name. see information on how to create your email here.
how to set up the local pickup app? local pickup is a really useful application for any merchant who, in addition to an online store, also has physical ones. the application has two main dimensions.
the first is that it allows the customers of the online store to pick up and pay for the goods at a specific physical place, which is represented by the respective store.
its other application is that it allows merchants to present what stock they have of certain products at different locations.
customers have access to information about where a product can be found - whether online, whether in a physical store a, b, and/or c. with the local pickup app you can add unlimited physical locations of your stores.
see the full article here. geo zones and geo polygons cloudcart allows the grouping of countries into geo zones (regions) regardless of their geographic location.
this helps you to easily set up discounts, taxes, special offers, and shipping methods in accordance with your marketing strategy. when creating your store, you do not have any geographic areas yet.
through these geographic areas, you can define cities or countries where your online store will operate.
by default, if you have not added any geographic areas, it is possible in your online store to place an order worldwide.
if you want to limit your store supplies and can only be ordered to specially defined countries or even cities, cloudcart allows you to add geographic areas.
for example, you want to have a special shipping method to be used only for customers who order in london, england.

how to choose a domain name for your store?,"what is a domain? a domain name is a combination of different latin characters that usually represent the content of your site and lead to it.
the name you will choose is your corporate identity in the online space.
that's why it's a good idea to take enough time before making your choice so that you don't have to change your domain name and lose customers later.
when you create a store in cloudcart, you get a free domain that accepts the name of cloudcart and looks like this: yourdomainname.cloudcart.net.
to build the identity of your business, we recommend that you buy your own domain. how to choose a suitable name?
here are some things to keep in mind when choosing a domain name for your cloudcart store.
choose a short and easy to write and find name - but be careful, as some short and meaningless letter combinations will not positively affect the popularity of your store.
it is important that the letters in the name match visually.
choose a name for your domain that matches your site&nbsp;- although it may seem logical at first glance, not every site has the same name as the domain.
it is advisable to name the site after your domain name because when people think of your site, they will remember it by name.
and if your name is the same as the url, they'll automatically know where to go. the name is a url, so they know what to type in the browser.
use keywords - try using keywords to describe the products or services you offer. the ones that customers write when searching for products or services like yours.
avoid numbers and dashes in the name&nbsp;- this often leads to confusion on the part of the customer and difficulties in finding and reaching your site.
although, if you still need and want numbers and dashes in your domain name, we recommend that you register different variations, just in case, so that even if the customer miswrites the name, he will still be able to reach your site.
use an appropriate extension for your domain - extensions are suffixes, such as .com or .net, at the end of the web address.
the most common is undoubtedly .com, but often names with this extension are taken. if you still manage to register yours, it's a good idea to take your domain name with more than one extension.
choose the more popular ones such as .net, .info, .eu, .bg, etc., so that regardless of the extension with which customers write the address, they will still be able to open your site.
don't delay - the sooner, the better! as soon as you choose the name for your domain, register it because the best ones sell quickly.
if you're having trouble figuring out a suitable name, some sites offer you a similar name to the one you're looking for.
when you buy a domain from cloudcart, our system also shows you different options if what you are looking for is not free.
if you already have a domain that you want to redirect to your new cloudcart online store, see this article. and why it's important to have an ssl certificate for your domain, see here.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000172767

we will look at two cases: the first one is how to add a primary domain by changing name servers (dns), and the second one - how to point a domain or subdomain as a cname record without using the cloudcart infrastructure but by pointing the domain or subdomain to the store.
adding an existing domain 1. to add a domain, log into your store admin panel, in the settings > domains section, in the upper right corner of the screen click on the add existing button. 2.
in the window that opens, enter the name of the domain you want to add and press the submit button. 3.
once you save the domain you will have to select one of the following two options: adding a domain by changing name servers the ""complete domain management and ddos protection"" option is free and recommended.
to enable it, you need to change the name servers of your domain. 1.
in the first scenario - ""complete domain management and ddos protection"" - you have full ddos protection and complete dns management from the admin panel.
click the enable dns record management button. 2.
then, the system will ask you to change the name servers with the ones shown below: for this purpose, go to your domain registry (e.g. name.com), enter the domain management console and change the name servers (example picture): it may take up to 48 hours to validate the name server change.
when the change is successfully validated you will be able to add the domain. 3. you can test again from the manage dns records button, and if the name servers are the same, all your records will be scanned. make sure that all your records are transferred.
if any of them are missing, you must recreate the respective records from the create dns record button. 4. then enable the domain from the on/off button and make it primary by pressing the set as primary button. 5. click on manage ssl, install the certificate automatically from the respective button and wait a few minutes for it to load on all servers.
adding a domain via a cname record the domain management via cname option is paid because we must provide you with a secure, static ip address (which requires payment).
in the second scenario, the domain name and name servers are managed not by cloudcart but by another service, such as the domain name registration service, and you do not want to change them. 1. press the manage with cname button. 2. go to your domain registry (e.g. name.com), enter the domain management console and before adding a domain to your store, create a cname record pointing at your official cloudcart domain, for example - [storename].cloudcart.net.
a cname record is short for ""canonical name"" and is used when you must point a subdomain to another domain or subdomain.
the address to which the redirect is done is also called a canonical or real address. in addition to [storename].cloudcart.net you can create a cname record pointing to www.
this way, no matter how the user types your domain in the browser, with or without www, the page will open.
below, the creation of a cname record is shown with the whole address of the domain pointing to [storename].cloudcart.net. 3. then enable the domain from the on/off button and make it primary by pressing the set as primary button.
in this case, you cannot manage the dns records from your store's admin panel, but you have the freedom to change all dns records from the domain registry. 4. click on manage ssl, install the certificate automatically from the respective button and wait a few minutes for it to load on all servers.
adding a subdomain via a cname record in the third scenario, you have a subdomain; the primary domain points to a service completely different from cloudcart and this service must add its domain to your store. 1. press the manage with cname button. 2. go to your domain registry (e.g. name.com), enter the domain management console and before adding the subdomain to your store, create a cname record pointing at your official cloudcart domain, for example - [storename].cloudcart.net. 3. then enable the domain from the on/off button. 4. click on manage ssl, install the certificate automatically from the respective button and wait a few minutes for it to load on all servers.

how to create a credit note in your cloudcart store?,"in this section: activating credit notes template for printing a credit note creating a credit note managing orders which have credit notes why is the credit note option not visible?
to make your business compatible with most eu states and the united states, in cases where you have a canceled or returned order that has already been paid, you need to issue a credit note.
a credit note is a commercial document that the merchant produces for the customer to notify the customer that credit is being applied to the customer for various reasons.
for example, the customer has returned the goods, the goods were damaged in some way, or there was a mistake in the price on the original invoice.
on the credit note, the merchant will list the products, quantities, and product prices agreed upon by both parties. then, the credit can be provided to the customer as money.
activating credit notes 1. to use this feature, you must have activated invoicing in your store from the settings > invoicing section. without invoicing you will not be able to create credit notes.
if the second option ‘issue an invoice only if a billing address is selected’ is turned off, that means that every order will be generated with an invoice, and you will be able to create a credit note on every order in case there is a canceled or refunded one.
a credit note cannot be issued for an order without a generated invoice. 2. the credit notification information is right after your company details in the invoicing section.
invoice number padding - this setting tells the system how many digits a credit note should have.
each credit note has unique credit numbers that differ from those on the invoice, although the two are related. ex.
if the credit memo number is 123 and you have set a fill of 10 digits, then the credit note number would look like this 0000000123 method of payment by cn - it specifies what payment method you will use to return the money.
if you choose ‘do not change the payment method’, the payment method that was originally used for the purchase will be used for returning the money.
if you select a different payment method, for example, bank wire transfer, each credit note by default will be generated with a bank wire transfer payment method.
тhe drop-down menu will display all the payment methods you have activated in your store. this setting cannot be changed on each credit note individually.
template for printing a credit note in the section, you don’t need to create a template yourself because the software comes with a default one for the pdf.
but if you want to make some changes to the pdf file, its structure, or add some other things, the variables in the legend are available to you and css classes that you can use to customize your credit note.
there is also a template that you can download, edit, and add below the css classes. creating a credit note go to a specific order marked as canceled or refunded and applicable for a credit note.
in addition to the standardly available options: ‘view invoice’ and ‘print order’ in the middle, you will see a third one - ‘credit note’ - in the upper right corner of the page.
*if the order is not marked yet you need to open the order's detailed page and click on the refund button or change its status to canceled/refunded from the drop-down menu at the top of the page then the 'credit note' option will appear.
important! credit notes are not automatically issued. instead, merchants need to generate their credit notes manually one by one.
if you want to create a credit note, click the ‘credit note’ button and choose the ‘create credit note’ option. otherwise, the credit note will not be created.
once the credit note has been created, the merchant can download the credit note as a pdf file or send the credit note to the client.
the credit note will be sent to the customer using a template for credit notes, which you can find in marketing > omnichannel > email templates > credit note.
this template will be used only for sending a credit note to the customer. it works the same way as all other templates. if you like the design, you can leave it as is.
managing orders which have credit notes go to the section orders > invoices. once you have a credit note created for a specific order, the credit note will be added to the invoices section.
thus, you can easily view all the credit notes that you have issued here. there are filters as well, which you can use to filter through invoices based on whether they have a credit note or not.
you can select all invoices with a credit note and download them at once using the tools option. learn more about order invoices here. why is the credit note option not visible? 1. you cannot create a credit note for an order made without an invoice. imagine that you had turned on the invoicing part later when you already have placed orders at your store.
the orders you received between the time you started your business and turned on invoicing will not have invoices, and for those orders, you will not be able to issue a credit note.
therefore, the credit note option will not be visible in the upper right corner of the page. 2. the second scenario in which the credit note option might not be visible and enabled is if under settings >
invoicing you have switched on the option ‘issue an invoice only if a billing address is selected’.
this means that if the customer does not provide a billing address, an invoice will not be issued, and unless there is an invoice, there will not be an option for creating a credit note.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000504015

с други думи, ако искате да взаимодействате с външна система, за да извлечете информация или да изпълните функция, api ви помага да съобщите на тази система какво искате, за да може тя да разбере и изпълни заявката.

how to verify domain property ownership?,"in this article, you will find out how you can verify ownership of your domain in front of different platforms using a single tool.
often, platforms such as facebook, google, and other services that issue ssl certificates, for example, require domain ownership validation by placing a piece of code in the merchant's online store.
there are several verification options - it can be pasting a text dns record, another option can be pasting an html file into the main folder of the store (not valid for cloudcart stores), and the third option, the most common one, is verification by pasting a meta tag.
we will now consider this way. an example of a meta tag is: themes and press the custom css/js button. 2. place your meta tag in the field.
if you have other codes in this field, we advise you to place the verification meta tag at the top to make the verification process easier and faster.
this will promote the correct recognition by the system of the respective verification site. after saving the changes from the edit button, you need to wait a while.
we recommend that this be approximately 24 hours before the verification attempt is made by the other party. this is necessary for several reasons.
one of them is that the other party may have already created a cache (backup) of your store, and your store itself also has a cache, which is presented in the customer part of the store, and in this case, it is best to wait long enough time to successfully validate your domain.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000487725

the user is looking for the expression ""red t-shirt"". the search is performed on the word ""red"" and the word ""t-shirt"" and the search result is 3 matches.
their sum of results is logarithmic to the total number of products. 10/3, the result found is multiplied by the sum of the matches for each product.
ex: for the word ""red"" we have two matches, and for the word ""t-shirt"" we have one match. the matches for the words are added = 3, then multiplied by the result of the logarithm of degree 2.
how sorting search results works first in the results are the products that exactly match the search term. second will be those who have more matches of each word of the expression, etc.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000498964

start accepting authorized payments,"in this section: what is an authorized payment? what kind of businesses can benefit from this type of payment? security of payment how to activate authorized payments?
order filtering what is an authorized payment? an authorized payment is an electronic payment in which money is withdrawn from a customer’s bank account and deposited into a business bank account.
this type of payment refers to the arranged payment agreement held between a business (payee) and a customer (payer). in the agreement, the payer provides bank details for access to withdraw funds.
on the day the authorized debit is scheduled for processing (when the order status is ""fulfilled"") or the moment the payee decides to manually request a capture of the payment, the funds are withdrawn from the payer's bank account.
funds are settled into the recipient's bank account a few business days later. learn about the benefits of authorized payments in the following blog article.
what kind of businesses can benefit from this type of payment? businesses that use units of measurement and sell products in bulk (vegetables, fruits, cereals, cosmetics, etc.).
with authorized payments, you'll be able to charge your customers exactly what they received.
if a customer ordered 5 kg of potatoes and 5 kg of apples, but when processing the order and measuring the products, it turns out 4.80 kg of potatoes and 4.70 kg.
apples, you will be able to withdraw the exact amount of the blocked debit and the customer will get the rest back.
all businesses that sell fashion, cosmetics, accessories, sporting goods, electronics, children's goods, home goods, and many more can benefit from the option of authorized payments.
in this way, you can save fees that are charged when an order is canceled and the amount should be refunded by bank transfer.
in addition, accounting operations such as issuing/canceling invoices, credit memos, etc. will be minimized.
ex: a customer makes a purchase of a jacket and shoes, and you fulfill the order while the order amount remains blocked on his card.
you wait for the 14-day statutory return period to ensure the customer will keep the items, then you manually capture the payment from the appropriate button and the amount goes into your account.
the pre-authorized debit cannot be accessed by the customer under any circumstances, so you have a secure payment that you can capture at any time, either automatically when the order is fulfilled or after a certain period manually, for example right after the expiration period for returning the goods.
note that you cannot take out more than the amount that is authorized by the customer.
when processing the order, it is important that the final value of the goods is equal to or less than the blocked amount on the customer's account.
the software will not allow you to execute the order if it is at a higher value than the original one.
if the order costs eur 100, but during processing, it turns out that the products are worth less than this amount (eur 95), especially in cases where you sell goods in bulk - fruits, vegetables, rice or, when a given product is no longer available, then you will deduct this eur 95, and the remaining amount will be released and the customer will receive it back.
this way, the customer is satisfied that has been charged only for what he has received, and you won't have to compensate him with vouchers, credits, etc.
security of payment increase customer confidence in making card payments online by accepting authorized payments. this type of payment provides maximum security for both merchants and customers.
the service is avaivable for both credit and debit cards. how to activate authorized payments?
to start accepting this kind of payment in your store, it is necessary to contact your servicing bank and state that you wish to activate the option for authorized payments.
this functionality** is only valid for certain payment providers. in your admin panel, go to the setting page of the payment method you use, and look for the option for authorized payment*.
*currently, this type of payment is offered by dsk and borica.
**the option is only active for enterprise and enterprise plus subscription plan merchant in the admin panel, the ""authorize payment"" section looks like this: automatic capture - in this method, after the merchant processes the order and marks it as fulfilled, the corresponding amount will be captured from the customer's account.
manual capture - in this method, the store administrator himself decides at what moment to deduct the amount from the customer's account.
the order payment status is ""pending"" and will remain so until it is captured manually or automatically.
if no action is taken by the merchant, each authorized payment has a statute of limitations (standard 30 days) according to the card operators' documentation, after which it is released.
if you as a merchant cannot fulfill the customer's order for any reason, you must release the withheld amount by canceling the authorization from the corresponding button.
order filtering in the ""orders"" section, a new type of filter has been added, with which you can filter all orders whose payment status is ""authorized"" and the amount is not ""captured"" and take appropriate actions.
more information about working with filters can be found here.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000534854

delivery boxes - how to use them?,"in this section why you need boxes? how to calculate the volume weight?
set up delivery boxes enable delivery boxes for a specific courier in general, delivery boxes or boxes for sending items (goods) to a specific customer are convenient when you want to successfully upsell your customers by selling more products into one box.
why you need boxes? the first reason is the online sale of products that are in a wider dimension. this means that you can sell keychains and sell bicycles at the same time.
thus, when selling bicycles, you need to calculate your prices or work with couriers who calculate their delivery prices depending on the volume weight. how to calculate the volume weight?
you have to measure the three dimensions of the product -height, length, width. to get the product volume weight, you need to multiply these dimensions and then divide the number you've got to 5000.
ex. if you have a product with a dimension: 100 cm x 100 cm x 100 cm (height, length, and width), to calculate the volume weight of this product, multiply 100x100x100 and then divide it to 5000.
the number you get is the product volume weight. based on that volume weight, the couriers calculate their pricing.
the calculating of product volume weight is important because if you send products that are not as heavy, but their size is large, the couriers need their volume weight to calculate the delivery prices and estimate the space that this box will take until it reaches the customer.
in the detailed product page in the admin panel, when you add or edit a product, there is a section called additional settings where you can enter the product dimensions: based on these dimensions (volume weight), you can send your products.
if a customer places an order in your store for a pillow, a keychain, and a bicycle, for example, you should combine the products of that order into one single pack instead of sending three separate packages.
in this way, the cost of sending the products to the customer will remain competitive.
set up delivery boxes first, to use this option, you must enter the dimensions of each of your products in the store (width, length, and height) to calculate the volume weight. 1.
after you have done that, go to the settings section > delivery boxes and add a box type by clicking on the button add new box in the upper right corner of your screen. 2.
in the box settings window, you need to enter some metrics: name: this name won't be visible to the end-customer, but it is useful for you to differentiate your boxes.
empty weight (gr) - enter the weight of the box itself. max weight (gr) - enter the maximum weight in grams that this box can withstand.
if the total weight of the products you want to put in this box is greater than that specified maximum weight in this field, this box type cannot be used for that shipment.
outer width (mm.\inch) - enter the outer width of the box. outer length (mm.\inch) - enter the outer length of the box. outer height (mm.\inch) - enter the outer height of the box.
inner width (mm.\inch) - enter the inner width of the box. that means that all products which are less than these dimensions can be added to this box.
the dimensions of the product must not exceed the inner dimensions of the box. inner length (mm.\inch) - enter the inner length of the box.
inner height (mm.\inch) - enter the inner height of the box. after you entered the box sizes, press the save button.
your first box will now be listed here: there is an algorythm built in the cloudcart software which takes all the products from the customer's cart with their dimensions and calculates weather those products can be handle by one of the added boxes in your store.
if there is no available (suitable) box for the particular purchase, then the customer will struggling to finalize his order.
so, it is really important to make sure that the type of boxes you have added in your store cover the dimensions of all of your products.
do not forget that all products should have dimensions (height, length, width), as well as weight.
enable delivery boxes for a specific courier to enable delivery boxes in your store, you need to go to shipping and enter the boxes as an option in the various couriers you use.
currently, two couriers work with boxes - dpd (speedy) and dhl. these two delivery methods will be visible in your admin panel if you have activated them and are working with them.
to activate delivery boxes to the selected courier, select the appropriate courier, and in the settings window, in the delivery boxes field, enter the types of boxes that you have previously created and want to use: when a customer finishes his order and chooses a delivery method that allows the use of delivery boxes when you open the order in your admin panel you will see that based on the size of the products from this order and the sizes of the boxes that you have created in your store, the system has automatically selected the appropriate box for this shipment.
no matter how many products an order consists of, if the total volume weight does not exceed the size of the delivery boxes you have, you can send all the products in a single box, which will not increase the cost of delivery, on the contrary.
this is the whole process of working with delivery boxes.
once created and activated for some of the delivery methods that support this feature, they will be automatically selected by the system when a customer orders products whose dimensions allow them to be placed in delivery boxes in your store.
this way you will not only save money on delivery, but you will also save time knowing which box to use for different orders.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000172730

how do i set up free shipping over a certain amount (speedy)? why can't i use econtomat for my shipments? my customers receive a message that no delivery method has been found.
how do i add an extra country and a relevant delivery method for this country? how do i set up free shipping on purchases over a certain amount?
to set up free shipping on purchases over a certain amount, you must add the appropriate setting (order rate) in the delivery method you use. can i delete a selected shipping method?
to delete a shipping method, it must be replaced with another method for all existing orders for which this method is selected.
you can create a shipping method that is manual and select it for orders that have the method you want to delete.
when the option for sending a shipment from a courier's office is enabled why the price remains the same as for picking up from the sender's address?
in order to be reflected correctly in the system, it is necessary to select a specific office from which you intend to send your shipments: can i specify two addresses for picking up a shipment (econt)?
it is not possible to pick up a shipment from more than one address from econt. but you can send the shipment to any econt office or from any address, regardless of the selected starting point.
it is important to observe the condition of whether the shipment is sent from an address or from an office so that there is no difference in price after the recalculation by the courier.
how do i set up free shipping for specific products? to set up free shipping for certain products, you need to create a separate category in which to put the respective products.
in the settings of the shipping method you use, specify the created category as an additional price condition.
what should i do in case of a problem with the courier service connection so that the order can be fulfilled?
we recommend that you use the fallback option by entering the delivery values in advance in the settings of the respective couriers you use (econt / speedy).
fallback will give a fixed delivery price, which will be taken into account in cases where there is a problem and no connection can be made to the courier system you are using.
is there a limit to the number of stores i can link to the same econt account? no, with the same econt data you can use an unlimited number of stores.
why do i receive a delivery date of one week for some orders with econt? cloudcart takes care of the proper synchronization between the providers you choose and your store.
delivery time depends on the suppliers themselves. our system receives a response from econt for the delivery date of each shipment and we show it to you.
for such type of questions, it is good to contact econt to find out the reason for the delay in deliveries and get detailed information.
when i try to log in to the econt system through the application, i receive an error message. note that the login details for ee.econt and those for third-party integrations are different.
contact econt for assistance or look for the data in your account at ee. econt. why is there a difference in calculating the delivery price in my two stores (econt)?
in order for the shipping price to be the same in your individual stores, you need to make the same settings. don't forget to choose an econt office for sending shipments.
otherwise, the system will not calculate the price from office to office or from office to address correctly. i cannot confirm my registration in econt via the email i received on my cloudcart mail.
due to increased security measures, your email account does not allow these types of links.
here's what you can do to turn off this setting: 1. go to https://mail.cloudcart.com and log in to your account. 2. go to your account when setting up the econt module i get an error - the payment methods field is mandatory. you must activate at least one payment method before setting up a shipping method.
then, in the settings of the econt module, you must select the appropriate payment method or select all methods if you have more than one in your store.
payment methods are set from the control panel, settings > payments section. how can i use the postal money order service (econt)? you can enable this option from settings > shipping >
econt > inventory. why can't i log in to the speedy module in my admin panel?
the username and password you must enter when installing the speedy application in your store are different from the ones you log in to the speedy site.
you can find them in your contract with speedy or contact them for assistance in case you do not find them in the contract. why, when i choose one provider, i can't change it with another?
when a quick order is placed in your store, you enter the delivery address through the control panel in the order edit window.
when initially selecting a provider, the customer address you entered is validated by the provider's system (econt / speedy), so you get an error when trying to change provider.
to change it you need to edit (rewrite) the client's address again, starting with the state. once you do this, you will be able to create a bill of lading.
how do i increase the number of automatic notifications for paid waybills? the number of included free automatic notifications for paid waybills depends on the subscription plan you have.
the business plan has 50 synchronizations, the enterprise plan 500. you can always purchase an additional number from your admin panel here.
how do i set up free shipping over a certain amount (speedy)?
in the speedy application, from the section ""type of service to address"" (the same applies to ""type of service to office"") you can select the option speedy calculator + free delivery, in which you can define the minimum value of the order for free delivery.
why can't i use econtomat for my shipments? if you want to use econtomat (for sending/receiving shipments) it is necessary to include this service in your agreement with econt.
otherwise, the system will not allow orders to be placed with these devices. my customers receive a message that no delivery method has been found.
when customers in your store cannot complete their order, due to such a message it is necessary to check the settings of the shipping method you use. enable the ""cash on delivery"" option.
if it's not enabled and you only have this form of payment activated in your store, your customers will see this error. how do i add an extra country and a relevant delivery method for this country?
you can create different geographic zones from settings > geo zones > add new geo zone.
after creating the desired country (zone) you need to connect it to the appropriate shipping method that will serve this zone.
from the settings > shipping section, you can create a new shipping method and link it to the region you want.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000485007

eu taxes,"when to charge vat?
if you have a cloudcart store and you are selling your products in the eu or other regions outside the union, you should understand when to charge vat on your sales and which rate to apply to each customer.
if your annual turnovers are below a certain threshold, you do not have to register for vat.
in that case, you do not charge vat on your sales regardless of where your customers come from, and you can skip the steps below.
if your business is vat registered, you have to charge vat to some of your customers and include your vat number in your invoices. here you can see a list of the vat registration thresholds.
whether or not to charge vat on a specific sale depends on which country your customer comes in and whether it is a consumer or a business. understanding vat taxes 1.
selling in your own country when you are selling in your own country, you are required to charge vat if your company is vat registered.
if the customer is from your own country, no matter if it is a company (b2b) or an end-user, the vat is always applicable. 2. selling in another country of the european union if you are selling to a different country within the eu, you have to distinguish between consumers and businesses.
if you sell a product to a company (b2b) registered for vat in the eu, which operates in another country of the union, you do not charge vat on this sale.
this company has to pay vat in its own country on the applicable rate for that state.
if you sell the same product to an eu end-user, you have to charge vat on this sale at the rate applicable in your own country, or you may have to charge vat at the rate applicable in their country if you have exceeded the country’s distance selling threshold-
this is the so-called vat of destination.

selling outside the eu if you sell your products to customers outside the eu, you do not charge vat.
however, you can deduct vat that you paid on related expenses, such as goods or services purchased specifically to make these sales.
in some countries, there are differences in the vat rates of certain product categories. take a look at the article for the tax overrides and exemptions.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000470009
vat of destination,"
if you sell goods outside bulgaria in other eu member states, you must monitor your sales and whether their value exceeds the threshold for cross-border sales, which is set by each eu country from 35,000 to 100,000 euros.
this means that if you have exceeded the permitted threshold of the country in which you sell, you are obliged to register your business there and apply the vat rate applicable in that country - this is the so-called vat of destination.

how to set up taxes,"in this article, you will find how to set up taxes in your cloudcart store.
in this section: set up taxes selling only in one country in order to charge vat to some customers and not to others, you need to set a global and local vat rate at your cloudcart store.
this means that all customers no matter whether they are from will see the vat rate at the cart or checkout steps.
but if a customer enters a foreign vat number (for ex. hungarian) upon checkout, cloudcart will try to validate this number and if it is valid, then the vat rate will be automatically removed from the total amount of the order.
the system knows which countries are part of the european union. the service we are using is https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/- vies.
please note that even if the customer has entered a local delivery address, but with a foreign vat number in his invoice data, then regardless of the fact that the goods will be delivered to a recipient in your country, the vat rate of the products in this order will be removed upon checkout.
important: the system removes vat, only on the basis of the billing address entered in the invoice data. it will not be removed, based only on the delivery address.
example: if a customer enters a foreign address in the delivery address field, but has not entered a valid vat number and a foreign address in the invoice data, the system will not remove the vat.
let’s set over to settings! set up taxes 1. log into your admin panel, go to settings > taxes and click on add tax button in the upper right corner of the screen.
this button will allow you to add global or local tax for a specific region.
please note, that if you haven't added a global tax and add a local tax first, the global tax will be automatically added to the tax list. 2.
in the window that appears, enter a name (local vat, global vat rate, etc.) and a description of the tax you are adding in the corresponding fields.
this information will be visible to your customers. 3. in the ""rate"" section set the percentage amount of the tax. 4.
in the section ""prices include taxes"" you should take into account whether your store operates in the european union and who are you selling to - companies (b2b) or end-customers.
if you enabled the button this means that all prices which a customer sees in the storefront are with included vat.
if the option is disabled, the prices which the customers will see in the storefront will be without vat.
the vat will be added to the products' prices when a customer reaches the last step of completing his order in the store, upon checkout.
if you sell goods only to businesses you don't have to charge vat on your sales. but if you sell to both - companies (b2b) and end-customers you need to add vat.
the most important distinction when it comes to charging vat and generating invoices in your store is whether your business is vat registered or not.

cloudcart will try to validate the vat number entered by your customer at the checkout and automatically remove the vat rate if the number is valid.
the service we are using is https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/ - vies.
if the vies service is not accessible at the moment of adding the vat number, cloudcart will accept it without validation. 2. selling outside european union - if your customer resides outside the eu, you do not charge vat.

how taxes are calculated,"it is important to understand how taxes are calculated because rounding can cause a slight discrepancy when comparing to tax when calculated at the subtotal level.
before, cloudcart rounded taxes at the invoice level by calculating the taxes on the order's subtotal and then rounding the results. now, the tax amounts are rounded at the line-item level.
in this case, the total tax value is calculated by applying the tax rate to each line in the order, rounding the result, and then adding these subtotals together to arrive at the total value of the order.
rounding taxes at the line level improves the calculation of different tax rates and makes it easier to calculate taxes for orders that include taxable and non-taxable products.
the taxes in cloudcart are rounded to two decimal places for each tax line. example suppose a customer places an order for 3 different items, each with a price of €6.99, including a 20% vat tax.
the line item tax for each product is €1.398. before, the tax of each line item would be added together, and the total would be rounded.
in this example, the added total tax would be €4.194, which would round to €4.19.
now cloudcart rounds tax amounts at the line-item level, which means the tax amount is rounded for every product individually.
the line-item tax amount of €1.398 is rounded to €1.40, which is then added together to get the total. in this case, the tax total would be €4.20.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000472435

for example, if a customer views one of the products included in a bundle, as an offer on the detailed page of the product he will see the entire package, which he can buy at a discount.
product bundles on product listing page when creating a product bundle, you should keep in mind that if it appears in a product listing (product catalog) it will appear in your store as a product, as one of all other products.

when customers open a detailed page of the bundle, they will see the products it contains and the reduced total price. the value of the discount is visible in the detailed page of the bundle.
after clicking on the bundle offer, they really see how much they would save. only the reduced price is indicated in the product listing, without the old price.

if you have multiple articles on your blog and don't want to recreate them one at a time, the cloudcart platform allows the use of csv (comma separated values) files to import multiple articles at once.
to do this, you need to have all your blog articles gathered in such a csv file. what is a csv file? csv file - this is comma-separated values (csv), which stores tabular data in plain text.

additional settings: from the drop-down menu you can select the author to whom the articles will be assigned.
when you initially create your store and write its name upon registration, it is automatically taken as the main profile and username with which you enter the admin panel of your store.
the system by default offers the name of the store and the author of all articles on your blog.
if you want to change the author name of your articles, you can either change your username or create a new administrator. 3.

this is an advanced feature suitable mostly for companies which have their own shipping method and use own transportation services.
this way, you can make adequate calculations based on the zip codes of the regions you deliver to.
to do this, you need to enter the postal codes you want, separated by commas, or set a series of codes by entering the first and last codes and separating them with an ellipsis (4 dots) or an asterisk (*).
you can see examples later in the article. in this section: create a new geo zone assign geo zone to a shipping method how does it look in the checkout?
create a new geo zone to use this functionality, go to your admin panel ->settings -> geo zones and add a new zone from the corresponding button.
add the geo zone name (for internal use only), select ""includes only post codes in a country"" from the drop-down menu, and then choose the country and add the zip codes.
there are three different ways of adding postcodes: range - enter the first and the last postal code of the region you want to set this geo zone for and put an ellipsis (4 dots) in between (1000....1200); enumeration - list the codes that of the region you want to set this geo zone for, by separating them with commas; postcodes containing a wildcard - you can also use wildcards, e.g. 100* means that all codes from 1000 till 1009 are included; 10** means that all codes from 1000 til 1099 are included; once you have set the zip codes, hit the 'save' button to continue.
assign geo zone to a shipping method once you have created geo zones, you need to assign them to a shipping method so that the price can be calculated accordingly and later to be displayed in the checkout as a shipping option.
go to settings > shipping > add shipping method.
in the settings window: enter the shipping method name turn off the ""global"" button in the ""shipping regions"" section select the zone you want to include from the drop-down menu enter the shipping cost how does it look in the checkout?
when the zip code of the customer's delivery address falls within the perimeter designation he sees the created shipping option: if the shipping address is outside this perimeter, delivery will not be possible.

how can i manage the seo on my store?,"seo stands from search engine optimization.
in time, the online search engines improved, their algorithms evolve and ""learn"" to better recognize the meaning behind each search, not just the keywords it contains.
this has resulted in search engine optimization going through a metamorphosis and eventually becoming an optimization for humans.
at its core, seo is the process of improving the visibility of a website in search engines through ""organic"" or algorithmic results, which involves optimizing the html code, structure and text of a website.
advertising on the site and increasing backlinks is another strategy for seo optimization.
in fact, the earlier (or earlier in the page) and the more often a site appears in the results, the more visitors are likely to generate a search engine.
thus, the site gets a presence on the internet. optimization can include various aspects, such as searching in a specific area or region, as well as searching for pictures, videos, or news.
to reach the seo section, log in to your control panel > marketing > seo optimization >
main seo canonical tag a canonical tag (aka ""rel canonical"") is a way of telling search engines that a specific url represents the master copy of a page.
using the canonical tag prevents problems caused by identical or ""duplicate"" content appearing on multiple urls.
practically speaking, the canonical tag tells search engines which version of a url you want to appear in search results.
deindex filtered & sorted pages set a noindex directive for any parameter based page that doesn’t add seo value. this tag will prevent search engines from indexing the page.
urls with a “noindex” tag are also likely to be crawled less frequently and if it’s present for a long time will eventually lead google to nofollow the page’s links.
if number 4 is entered in the de-indexing field, this means that after 4 parameters it will start to put noindex and will not be indexed - mysite.com parameter1 = 1 & parameter2 = 2 & parameter3 = 3 & parameter4 = 4 on the page and on mysite.com?parameter1=1&parameter2=2&parameter3=3&parameter4=4&parameter5=5 will put noindex.

what are upsell and cross-sell?,"in this article, you will find out what cross-sell and upsell offers are and in which cases it is good to use them to increase your revenue. what is upsell?
the upsell aims to increase the value of the order by offering a replacement /upgrade/ of the product with another similar one at a slightly higher price.
that is, if your customer is ready to buy a product from your online store, you can apply upsell offer to offer him a higher class of the same type of product at a slightly higher price.
customers are usually willing to buy a better product if the difference in price is ""bearable"". and what is a ""bearable price""? one that justifies the value of the product.
ie the better you present the product, the more inclined the customer will be to buy it.
however, keep in mind that the price of the new product should not exceed the price of the old by more than 25%. types of upsell 1.
upsell with a similar product it is suitable for products that have a long-term investment as a technique, for example. take a laptop for example.
if your customer liked a particular laptop model, you can offer him a higher class with more functionality, and respectively, a higher price. what is important here?
describe in detail the characteristics and advantages of the laptop you will offer the price should be tempting, however, it must not exceed the price of the selected laptop by more than 25% think about the marketing text that will make your customer look at the laptop you offer him.
it needs to be catchy! 2. upsell with a discount suitable for products that are used daily - such as clothes, shoes, cosmetics, nutritional supplements, etc. let's take cosmetics for example.
if your client liked a hair shampoo or face mask, you can offer him another product of the same type at a higher price with a specific discount.
initially, the customer does not intend to buy a more expensive product, but this offer seems ""irresistible"" to the customer, which in turn will bring you extra profit.
the chance of the client to accept the offer is great, especially if he is a regular customer. what is important here?
differentiate your clients to ""new"" and ""regular"" so that you can offer a discount that will appeal to the particular client and at the same time will be a good option for you; the discount can also be in the form of ""free shipping"" think about the marketing text that will make your client literally snatch the discount product! 3. upsell with an additional service suitable for products that need support.
if we go back to the example with the laptop - instead of a better laptop, you can offer support for the laptop at a discounted price.
additionally, you can offer both a better laptop and support at the same time. the second option is ""double upsell"".
surely you can think of other combinations to get the customer to spend more money and at the same time get extra value from the final purchase. what's important here?
knowing the products in-depth and what additional services can be offered having the option to actually offer a different service for each individual product to think about a catchy marketing text, which will seduce the customer to explore the new option you are offering.
what is cross-sell simply put, cross-sell is a sale of similar products, that have a logical connection to the product selected by the customer.

how to create an effective cross-selling?,"upsell and cross-sell offers / strategies are a huge opportunity for any business, through which you can optimize your profits without spending extra money on advertising.
in this article, we will go through all the steps of creating a successful cross-sell offer in your cloudcart store. what is cross-selling?
in general, cross-sell is the sale of complementary products, ie. of products that have a logical connection with the product selected by the customer.
if with upsell the goal is to offer a product that is an upgraded version of the product selected by the customer, then with cross-sell we offer a product that would be a supplement to it.
before showing how to set up this type of offer with our functionality, it is important to remember that we should always offer our customer the opportunity to purchase additional products, as in many cases he did not realize that he would need them.
the cross-sell offer gives the customer information that you also offer these products, and this is a guarantee that they will think of you when they need them.
take advantage of the fact that cross-selling is not perceived as annoying by the customer!
complementary cross-selling this is the most common variant of cross-sell - you offer an additional product that complements the value of the product selected by the customer (for example, if the customer wants to buy a phone, you can offer him headphones).
example: in this image you see existing cross-sell offers from a cloudcart merchant that has registered extremely good results.
his best cross-sell offer has been seen 542 times, with 119 people accepting it by adding it to their cart but only 78 of them have successfully completed their order.
this cross-sell offer has led to nearly bgn 1,200 in additional turnover for the merchant, for the generation of which no money has been spent because the functionality in cloudcart is completely free, optimizing the profit from one customer.
in the image, you can see other cross-sell offers, which do not have such impressive results, but nevertheless, these offers have helped the merchant to make the buyers from his store spend more and thus he can earn more without doing anything but preset the offer.
how to set up cross-sell? 1. to set up your first cross-sell offer you need to log into your admin panel, go to apps section > all apps > cross-sell & upsell, and click on the install button. 2.
to create an offer click on the button in the upper right corner of your screen.
after you have installed the application a new subsection will appear in the marketing section where you can access cross-sell & upsell: 3.
in the window that opens, enter the title of the offer - you have the opportunity to enter a system title (for your own usage), and a marketing title for your offer to grab the attention of customers who will see it.
e.g. wait! do you want to add this product to your order? congratulations! you just unlocked a big discount! hey! don't miss this opportunity! hey! don't miss these 20/30/40% discounts!
if you turn on test mode, only you will be able to see the offer to check how it works and looks before activating it and making it visible to customers. 4. write your marketing description that literally in one sentence clarifies what the user gets from you and answers the question ""why should i add this product to my order?""
be specific in the description, giving as much information as possible, but in no more than 2 lines, e.g. add product 2 with x% discount + free shipping. already x people have done it!
add product 2 with an x% discount and save x eur from your order. already x people have done it!
this type of description should give the customer a clear idea of the benefits of this offer - to save money and be confident in the quality of the product.
(as soon as x other people have ordered it). in the next sub-section, you need to set the visual settings of your offer. we recommend that they be consistent with the design of your site.
background color - this is the background color of the window in which the offer will be displayed - make it neutral (gray/white or other light colors) so that the text and description of the offer are easy to read.
text color - this is the color of the title of the offer - we recommend that the color of the text be black or contrasting with the background button background color and button text - a visual combination for the button.
we recommend that the color of the button be green, as this color has a positive effect on users and psychologically makes them click on the button. 5. choose the conditions of your offer.
where to display the cross-sell offer (at which step of the user path) - see all possible places shown in the image below. for which product (s) to activate the cross-sell offer.
which products to be offered in the cross-sell offer choose how to display/activate the offer and how many different products to include.
when choosing the number of products to display via pop-up, always check how the offer is displayed on mobile devices.
from our tests and feedback from retailers, we concluded that 1, 2 or 4 products are best visualized and do not interfere with the user experience.
in the next step, you can choose not to display products that are already out of stock and those that are already in the customer's cart.
in the last step, you can give your customers an additional discount to be applied to the products offered in the cross-sell offer.
if you choose the offer to include an additional discount (extended), then you will be able to choose from the following options: fixed amount to reduce the price of the proposed product percentage % by which to reduce the price of the offered product free shipping upon acceptance of the cross-sell offer free product as a gift keep in mind that if you select the ""free product as a gift"" option when adding more than one free product, only the cheapest product will be free.
once you are done with setting the offer, click the ""save"" button and be sure to go to the page of your product and test how your offer is displayed depending on the settings.
before placing an offer for all users of your site, we advise you to first make a test product that is hidden from the mass audience of your site to use for such tests and settings.
once you are sure that the offer is set up correctly, you can simply go into the settings and change the product for which this cross-sell offer was originally created.

in this article, we will go through all the steps of creating a successful upsell offer in your cloudcart store. what is upselling?
upselling aims to increase the price of the main purchase by offering a product of the same type with a higher value.
that is, if your customer is ready to buy a product from your online store, you can apply an upsell offer by offering him a higher-class product of the same type at a slightly higher price or make him buy a more expensive package with more products.
before showing how to set up this type of offer in your cloudcart store, it is important to remember that the upsell offer in this case should not be more expensive than 20-30% of the price of the initially desired product by the customer.
it is very important for all merchants to understand that consumers have a psychological price threshold that they will have to overcome, using an ""appetizing"" and valuable offer and offered with originally written text to make the consumer replace their chosen product with a more -expensive one.
if the original product that the customer wants to buy costs eur 50, then you must offer him a more expensive product with a maximum price between eur 60-70, so as not to take the customer out of his comfort zone.
how to create an upsell offer? 1. go to your admin panel, apps section > all apps > cross-sell & upsell, and click on the install button. 2.
to create an offer click on the create new offer button in the upsell section.

e.g. wait! we have a better deal for you! congratulations! you just unlocked a big discount! hey! don't miss this opportunity! hey! don't miss these 20/30/40% discounts!
this type of title grabs extra attention and makes the user read the following lines because it arouses his interest.
of course, each title has its place depending on the type of upsell offer you will create if you turn on test mode, only you will be able to see the offer to check how it works and looks before activating it and making it visible to customers. 4. write your marketing description that literally in one sentence clarifies what the user gets from you and answers the question ""why should i change the product?""
be specific in the description, giving as much information as possible, but in no more than 2 lines, e.g. add product 2 with x% discount + free shipping. already x people have done it!
add product 2 with an x% discount and save x eur from your order. already x people have done it!
this type of description should give the customer a clear idea of the benefits of this offer - to save money and be confident in the quality of the product.
(as soon as x other people have ordered it). button text and cancel button text can be: i want the offer :) add to cart :) yes, i want it! :) no, thanks! :( 5.
in the next sub-section, you need to set the visual settings of your offer. we recommend that they be consistent with the design of your site.
background color - this is the background color of the window in which the offer will be displayed - make it neutral (gray/white or other light colors) so that the text and description of the offer are easy to read.
text color - this is the color of the title of the offer - we recommend that the color of the text be black or contrasting with the background button background color and button text - a visual combination for the button.
we recommend that the color of the button be green, as this color has a positive effect on users and psychologically makes them click on the button. 6. specify the start date and the end date of the offer, or set no expiration.
if you have a specific promotion valid for the entire site, which expires on a certain day, then set an end date on which the upsell offer will stop showing.
if you do not have an offer for the entire site but have simply created a special upsell offer, you can leave the initial setting ""no expiration"" to take advantage of the constant display of the offer when a certain action is performed by a user. 7. choose the conditions of your offer choose which product to activate the upsell offer for and which product to replace the original product with. 8.
additional offer settings - you can activate the option to show only the difference in price, which must be paid extra.
- you can activate the option to match the number of products - you can set a setting in which the upsell offer will be displayed only if the product selected by the customer is out of stock.
- display effect - this option allows you to set the way your offer will be displayed - confetti, fireworks, or school pride.
after selecting one of the three options, a test button will appear on the left, from which you can see what the effect looks like.
once you are done with setting the offer, click the ""save"" button and be sure to go to the page of your product and test how your offer is displayed depending on the settings.
before releasing the offer to all users of your site, we advise to first make a test product that is hidden from the general audience of your site to use for such tests and settings.
once you are sure that the offer is set up correctly, you can simply go into the settings and change the product that this upsell offer was originally created for.

how to enable 'product is back in stock' customer notifications?,"
much in demand among online merchants today is the functionality to provide their customers with the ability to subscribe in order to receive notifications when an out-of-stock product is back in stock.
the cloudcart system requires setup while the product is out of stock and relevant messages will be sent to your customers when it becomes available.
in this section: setting status creating segments creating an automated campaign ""expected products"" section setting status 1. go to your admin panel, from the products >
product statuses menu, go to the product statuses page by default, there are two statuses - in and out-of-stock.
you have two options to create the possibility for your customers to subscribe for a product that is out of stock. 1. the first option is to change the behavior of the out of stock status 2.
the second option is to add a completely new status we recommend you to use the first option and change the behavior of the out of stock status.
to change the behavior of the out of stock status, click on it and select 'show as subscribe for quantity' from the drop-down menu.
when you choose this action on the product page, a button will show that allows your users to subscribe to this particular product.
it would also be nice to change the status's name, e.g. 'notify me, when available. this will be the button's name when you come across a product that is not in stock.
this is what a similar product looks like on the storefront: creating segments 1. go to the marketing > campaigns > segments section and create a new segment by pressing the add segment button. 2. click on add condition and select 'subscribed for product availability from the drop-down menu. this is quite enough to segment a customer list by this criterion.
still, if you want to, you have the opportunity to divide your customers into more specific groups by product, category and vendor.
it is not recommended to use the options for more detailed segmentation by product, category and manufacturer, as this may result in some customers not receiving the notifications they have subscribed to.
you may have put their product in category a and it is in category b. 3. once you are done, hit save and wait a while.
segmentation does not take place in real time and it may take time to generate the list. creating an automated campaign 1. go to marketing >
campaigns > automated, and create a new campaign from the create campaign button.
enter a title and be sure to enable the option repeat the campaign for customers that got into it more than once so that your users can enter this campaign again and again.
if this option is turned off, a user who has once entered the campaign will not go into it in the future. that is why ensure that is turned on so you can communicate with your users over time. 2. then select the segment in section 2 from the drop-down menu in the middle: 3.
the mandatory information to fill in is the campaign actions in section 3, where a communication channel must be selected: we recommend you to use viber and web push notification because they are very fast, have a significant open rate and users are used to using them for such type of communicaten while email is mostly an official type of communication. 4.
the cloudcart suite allows you to use 2 or more actions - so we can first select email as a communication channel, let the action implement immediately and create the following template: the email address, name, subject and text are easy to fill in.
the important thing is that we want the product that triggered the campaign to be present in the email: this product is a variable called triggered products, and you can select it from the menu on the right. 5. when you are done, hit the save button to save the template and save step. 6. you can go on with the second step - to select viber, sms or even set up a condition to see if an email has been read, clicked and then send another viber message after a few days.
creating a condition looks like this: if the condition is met (e.g. the link was clicked), remove the subscriber from the campaign because this means that the customer is aware that the product is online again.
otherwise, continue with the next step. 7. press the save condition button. 8. the next step will be a viber message reminding you that the specific product is online again.
here's a sample viber message you can use for this purpose: note that the {triggered_products:1} variable is included again. 9. save the condition, save the step, and your campaign is ready.
this campaign is built for users subscribed to receive notifications about a specific message.
if they constantly subscribe to different products, this campaign will run for them because you have enabled the option 'repeat the campaign for customers that got into it more than once'.
the first communication channel is email, and we check if the link is opened or not.
if it is opened, we will remove the subscriber from this campaign, if it is not opened, in one day, we will send a reminder on viber. 10. you can add tags 11.
you can specify the purpose of the campaign 12.
once you are done with the settings of your campaign, click on the start button, otherwise, if you click on the save button only, the campaign will be saved as a draft and will not be enabled.
note that once the campaign is launched, you will not be able to make any changes to it. so before you launch it, make sure you have everything set up the way you want it.
when someone subscribes to be notified when a product is back in stock, the email they will receive when the product is back in stock will look like this: ""expected products"" section go to the ""products > expected products"" section in this section are the products for which the customers have signed up to receive a notification when available.
if the total quantity of a product is more than 0, the ""create campaign"" button is displayed and leads to the creation of a new campaign, and if the quantity is 0, the button only indicates how many customers have signed up to receive a notification when a product is available and directs to a filter in the ""subscribers"" section, which shows these subscribers.
in the cloudcart marketing suite dashboard, the marketing section displays expected products, sorted in descending order based on how many customers have signed up to be notified about them.
this is all you need to do to give your customers the option to subscribe to receive notifications when a product is available again.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000530757

discount types - why and how to use them effectively,"what type of discounts you can offer to your clients and when to use them to maximize your business profit.
discounts are a powerful tool that helps you sell more products to your customers, as well as increase your customer base.
constant retail sales such as black friday or cyber monday have desensitized consumers that they are often reluctant to pay the full price.
almost four out of 10 consumers are ready to look for another e-shop to see if they can find the same item for less money.
however, it is very important not to be under constant pressure to lower your prices because in the long run, it will do more harm than good.
instead, in this article, we'll let you know when and how to effectively apply discounts to customers in your cloudcart e-shop so you can compete without losing your shirt.
there are two main groups of discounts - discounts that are displayed in the product catalogue - they are visible when the customer navigates through your web store and do not require any action on his part.
these reductions are visible and automatically applied.
in order to take advantage of these discounts visible in the product catalogue, your customers must add items that are part of the promotion and / or items that they must purchase in order to qualify for a discount.
the other main group of discounts are the ones applied upon check out /promo codes/. you can create codes for a value discount, a percentage discount, or a free shipping discount.
customers have to enter discount codes at checkout. when a customer uses a discount code, the discount will only apply to the items to which it is applicable.
in this section the following types of discounts are the ones you can set in your cloudcart e-shop. global discount
this discount type allows your customers to see the discount in their checkout and the total amount of their order. it can be in the form of value, percentage or free shipping discount.
you can also define the discount target based on orders, exact product, or a product category as well as select customer groups.

discounts faq,"in this section: why customers can't see the upsell and cross-sell offers i've created? why is the information about the reduced prices of products from the xml feed not synchronized correctly?
can i create a loyalty program for accumulating points and discounts? when i enter a discount code, i receive an invalid code message.
can i set a different discount for certain products from a category to which a discount has already been created? can i edit the product price if i have already received an order in my store?
can i create a quantity discount only for a certain variant of a product? how do i set a discount to apply only to non-discounted products?
how do i create a link to a product with an applied discount, which is automatically added to the cart? can i combine two or more orders of the same customer?
how do i create a discount that applies automatically above a certain amount? does cloudcart support gift cards/vouchers? why customers can't see the upsell and cross-sell offers i've created?
if the offer you created is not displayed, check its start and end dates in the settings of the offer itself. each offer you create must have a set start date of validity.
also, make sure that your offer is not in test mode (sandbox). when an offer is in test mode, it is only visible to logged-in store administrators.
more information about cross-sell and upsell offers can be found here. why is the information about the reduced prices of products from the xml feed not synchronized correctly?
make sure the job you want to sync is active, not a draft. if you start editing a job and get to the second step but do not fully complete it, the job remains as a draft.
in order for discounted prices of products imported via xml to be active, be sure to add a discount to the job in step 1.
please note that it takes time in the store from which the information is provided to generate an up-to-date xml feed. this takes some time.
if the synchronization passes before the latest xml feed is ready, the current price reductions will not be visible, they will be reflected in the next synchronization. see more here.
can i create a loyalty program for accumulating points and discounts? you can create a customer group (for example, loyal customers), then in marketing >
discounts create a fixed discount to apply to the desired customer group. there is currently no option to create a virtual card to collect bonuses or accumulate points.
when i enter a discount code, i receive an invalid code message. if your discount is for a specific amount, the discount given by the respective code must not exceed the amount in the cart.
that is, if the discount is eur 100, the amount in the cart must be at least eur 100.
please note that the shipping cost is not included in this calculation and is not subject to a discount through a discount.
can i set a different discount for certain products from a category to which a discount has already been created?
if the products whose price you want to reduce are already included in some discount (i.e. -50%), valid for the whole category and give them another discount other than this, (i.e. -30% ), then in the storefront the price with discount -50% will be displayed.
the system always offers the best price to the customer. can i edit the product price if i have already received an order in my store?
yes, the product price can be edited after the order has been placed. to do this, you must first remove all discounts applied to the order and then change the value with the one you want.
the removal of the discounts, if any, is necessary because even if you change the price, it will not be generated. it will be recalculated and the original price will be retained.
if the order is prepaid you will need to mark it as pending in order to make changes. can i create a quantity discount only for a certain variant of a product?
the quantity discount works only for certain products (including their variants) and makes a discount based on quantity.
that means that the discount you create will apply to all variants of this product.
the fixed discount allows you to set different promotional prices for each variant, but there are no conditions for the number of products.
how do i set a discount to apply only to non-discounted products? to create a discount that only applies to non-discounted products, select discount with a promo code.
only this type of discount can be applied only in carts with products that are not with reduced prices. for other types of discounts, such a restriction does not apply.
when several different discounts are applied to a product, customers will see the price for that product with the biggest discount.
how do i create a link to a product with an applied discount, which is automatically added to the cart?
to make this idea happen, you can create a landing page, on which you display the desired product and create a discount with a promo code, which is clearly visible and which customers themselves add.
the other alternative is to use a link like the one below https://okserta.bg/cart/discount:hilyalm10. this link directs the customer to the cart with an added item an already applied discount.
how do i set up a discount with a promo code to be applied on non-discounted products when there are discounted products in the cart?
you need to set the discount with a promo code to be applied for specific products whose price is not discounted.
you also need to mark the discount to be applied in the cart with other discounted products. can i combine two or more orders of the same customer?
the option to combine orders is not implemented in the platform, because the documentation for each order entered in the store is an important document when reporting revenues and expenses to government agencies.
what you can do is create a discount with a promo code, by which to remove the shipping price, if the total amount of the orders of the customer is above the required amount of the order for free shipping: this discount does not have to be shared with the audience.
you can apply it when processing an order for which you want to take full shipping when it was charged according to a global condition.
for this purpose choose add order discount: how do i create a discount that applies automatically above a certain amount?
to apply it automatically when the amount of the order is above a certain amount, you need to create a type of standard discount and in the field discount target choose orders over after which you enter the desired amount.
does cloudcart support gift cards/vouchers?
the cloudcart platform itself has not developed a feature for customer wallet and balance tracking vouchers but through the online payment application stripe, you could also use giftup and add them from there.

order statuses at discount section,"in this section: what are discount statuses and how to use them? troubleshooting what are discount statuses and how to use them?
order statuses at the discount section or discount statuses are equal to the order statuses. order statuses indicate whether an order is valid or not.
based on that validation in the discount section (marketing > discounts), you can set the order statuses which will increase the number of uses for discounters from the statuses button.
you decide which statuses to set, but if you don't select any, the default statuses are: paid, fulfilled, or completed.
this way you tell the system when to increase the number of uses of the specified type of discount or not to change it at all.
when a discount is applied and the customer's order has one of the statuses you have set, only then, the number of times the discount has been used will increase, and this will be reflected in the uses column.
note that the order statuses does not affect the number of uses for all types of discounts.
discounts whose number of uses is affected by the status of the orders you have set are: discount with promo code, discount with multiple promo codes and countdown discount.
troubleshooting in some cases, e.g. if you are using ""cash on delivery"" as a payment method and a customer selects it in the checkout, the order status will be ""pending"".
in this case, if you have not selected the status ""pending"", the usage of the discounts won't be increased.
that's why it is very important to pay attention to which statuses and in which cases to add as order statuses in the discounts section.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000493491
understanding discounts,"in cloudcart there are two main groups of discounts. the first group, these are the discount that are applied directly to specific producs or groups of products.
they are visible to customers directly or indirectly on the page of the product itself. these types of discounts are product catalog level discounts.
this type of discounts does not require any additional action from the customer, these discounts are visible in the product listing. (global , fixed, quantity discount, buy x get y, etc.)
the second group are cart level discounts. this means that at the cart level there will be options for applying the discounts that the customer has.
(discount with promo code, doscount with multiple promo codes, countdown discount).
product catalog level & cart level discounts кeep in mind that when you create a discount, sometimes the system will take some time to reflect the discount on the customer side of your store.
this is because creating a discount is a separate task that takes some time to complete (usually from a few seconds to a few minutes) example for product catalog level discount (global discount):
if you create another discount and you decide to turn off this one, you won't be able to activate it again until 10 minutes are passed.
this is because, as we mentioned, each discount you create is a separate job.
as you know, the cloudcart system works with queue jobs, and turning on and off the discounts you just created, will retard the performing of other tasks that you have in your store.
therefore, you must wait about 10 minutes before activating an already deactivated discount. how they work 1.
if you have two or more discounts from the same type, the system will apply the one with a higher value. customers will see the products with the biggest discount you have activated in your store. 2.
in case you have created a product catalog level discount, such as the global discount, and create a discount with a promo code (cart level discount) applicable to the same products, then customers will be able to take advantage of both discounts.
this is because the two types of discounts are different and work differently.
example: as you can see in the image below, the price of the product has already been reduced because there is a global discount
but after the customer enters the discount code at the checkout, the price is further reduced: if you don't want to give your customer more than one discount you have to unselect the option that says ""apply discount even if the cart contains products with a discount"" in the date range section.
in this case, when а customer trying to use the promo code for an already reduced product with another discount, the system will display the following message: the discount with a promo code won't be applied even if its value is greater than the value of the other discount that is already applied to the product.
the rule for applying the bigger discount will not apply here, as the option for applying two discounts at the same time is excluded and these two types of discounts are not from the same group - one is cart level and the other is product catalog level discount.
it is a very useful feature, especially if you have thousands of products and hundreds of promo codes or product level catalog discounts, with which you can control which discounts when to apply and under what conditions.
in this way, you will prevent giving bigger discounts to customers than you have planned. see more information about the different types of discounts in this section of our help center.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000494563

understanding order statuses,"
good knowledge of the different statuses of orders is important to understand and monitor how and under what conditions the subsequent processes take place, for example - reducing the quantity, customer notifications, creating invoices and more.
types of statuses each order received in the cloudcart store has three statuses. shipping (fulfillment) status - this status indicates whether an order has already been shipped or not.
the payment status of an order (payments) - the type of status is determined depending on the payment method that the customer has chosen. different payment methods submit different order statuses.
in general, they are several types - completed, canceled, paid, held, refunded. basic status of the order (orders) - it is formed on the basis of the above two statuses.
each order has two buttons for setting the status according to the respective criteria: payment - mark as paid button (if the payment method is offline - cash on delivery or bwt) shipping - fulfill products button
the system takes the information that you as a merchant mark for an order, whether it has been sent and whether it has been paid, and thus the status of the entire order is formed.
how statuses change when certain actions are performed orders with pending status - an order can be entered with such a status when its payment is via offline payment method - cash on delivery, bank transfer.
an offline payment method is considered to be one in which there is no verification of this payment, it is not made in the cloudcart store itself, but is performed by third parties.
there is only a payment request from the client. therefore, such an order acquires the status of pending.
in case of an order with the status of pending, you as a trader should perform some action, it can be - fulfillment products. in this case, the order acquires a new status fulfilled.
the customer who placed this order then receives an email notification that the order has been sent to him.
in the picture below you can see a simple order status flow diagram: reducing the quantity of goods depending on the status of the order the quantity of products in the store, part of this order could change if in the cart & checkout settings, processing orders section, for the option ""i want to decrease product quantity when the status is "" you set the product quantity to be decreased when the order status is pending /fulfilled.
you can also set the quantity to decrease only if the status is paid or/and fulfilled. if you select the option to decrease the quantity when the order status is pending /fulfilled
this means that if the order has one of the two statuses, the quantity will be reduced.
when an order enters your store and it has the status pending (most often if you work with cash on delivery or bank transfer for example), the quantity of the product/products from this order will be automatically reduced.
if you select the other option the quantity to be decreased when the status is paid /fullfilledt, this means that the quantity will be reduced only when it is marked as either paid or sent.
how to change the order status which has been already marked as fulfilled?
after marking an order as fulfilled, you can change its status again by opening the order and marking it from the mark as fulfilled button, then select another status from the drop-down menu - you can mark it as refunded, cancelled, and so on.
for orders that are already marked as fulfilled, you cannot change the shipping address and the customer's billing address.
if you still want to make certain changes, you need to mark it again as unfulfilled.
payment statuses when you mark an order as paid, its status can never be changed to ""pending"", unlike the shipping status, which you can change from ""fulfillment"" to ""unfillment"".
but you can mark it as ""refunded"" if the customer has changed his mind. when fulfilling an order with the status paid and send it, its main status will become completed.
if the two statuses (shipping status and payment status) are marked as fulfilled and paid, then the order is with the status completed. important:
an invoice number is only generated when the status of the order has been paid or fulfilled. from the menu, section orders from tools, you can select and archive all completed and canceled orders.
filter by order status you can filter your orders according to the different statuses they have.
from the menu, section orders> filters, from the drop-down menu select the status by which to filter the orders.
status groups there are two main status groups in your cloudcart store: service - these are the statuses that are part of your store by default and that you see.
added by an administrator (merchant) - these are the statuses you have added to your store. from the menu, section settings >
statuses> orders, in the upper right corner from the add new status button you can add new statuses.
these statuses can be any that would be convenient for you to use and mark orders, for example, to mark an order that needs attention.
you can also use the statuses you have created to filter orders and to transmit certain information through the system, for example through webhooks.
the statuses you add do not initiate email notifications to the client, ie they are not visible to the clients, but initiate the sending of a webhook. only service statuses are sent to clients.
what is a webhook, you can read here. dividing the statuses into three types in your admin panel is extremely useful, as this way you can track the current status of each order.
in addition, this way your store software transmits information to other systems via cloudcart apis and webhooks in real-time. find out how to manage your orders here.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000473911

product statuses are extremely useful, as they give consumers the necessary information about the products you offer in your store and thus encourage them to perform a certain action.

from the drop-down menu, you have different options to choose from - less than, more than, equal to, without tracking the amount, and more.
that is, according to the condition you set in this field, the action you selected in the previous field will be performed for all products with this status.
in your store, on the detailed page of the respective product that is with such a status, these statuses look like this: for each status, especially for products with the status ""in stock"", the number of available products can be shown if you want your customers to see this information.
this can be done by going to the my store > widgets > products > detail information for product section.

this feature is useful if a product has a status of ""limited quantity"" to show the specific number.
this will encourage customers to make a purchase faster, as you are showing them that there is a real danger that the product will soon be out of stock.
turned on in the store this option looks like this: the default statuses apply globally to all products in the store for which the quantity tracking option is enabled and you have set the available quantities, except when you have manually set a specific status for a specific product, then it applies exactly.
in cases where the quantity tracking function is not included, there is no limit and the customer can order regardless of the actual quantity.
mapping default statuses from the button in the upper right corner map default statuses, you can choose which status for available products and which for unavailable ones to apply.
these default statuses are used to determine which status to apply if different statuses have the same actions and similar application conditions.
for example, status test 1> with action ""hide buy button""> provided ""quantity 0"" and status test 2> again with action ""hide buy button""> provided ""quantity less than 1"".
because each product can only have one status, the default statuses determine which of the two statuses applies. the default statuses take precedence when deciding which status to apply.

this action will add a button from which users will be able to inquire about a product. the button will open a window in which customers can leave email and names and send a request. 3.
in the field if the quantity is - you set the condition under which the set action will be performed for the status created by you.
once you create a status for products, all products that meet the quantity condition of that status will automatically accept the action and status name.

the echappe theme supports a widget for last viewed products. why, when importing products with a csv, are the images not uploaded yet?
importing images is a separate task and sometimes takes a little longer. images are uploaded with a delay because separate servers are processing them.
they are usually uploaded within a few hours, depending on the number of products you upload.
if more than 12 hours have passed and you still do not have images, you will need to try again to import them and/or check for an error.

can i use the search engine on the site to search for blog articles other than products? the search engine on the site indexes only the products.
however, since the focus of every online store is effectiveness in the sales of the products offered, the design of the search engine and the platform itself are oriented towards the ultimate goal - making a purchase on the part of users.
can i select only certain product categories through apps such as also, polycomp, etc.? you can select categories if you have already created such in your store.
you need to point in the application's settings which category of the provider to flow into which category of yours in the store.

yes, there is such a possibility determined by the store's theme (design). the summer or flair designs allow you to display two products per row.

you can quickly and easily make bulk changes to the product catalog through the google sheets app.
you can read how it works on the following page: how to make bulk changes to your product catalog with the google sheets app.
why is the original price not shown in the product packages but only the discounted one? the presentation of a package of products on a category page must show one final value of a package price.
this is per the legal provisions and the cpc, and that is why the cloudcart system works this way. you can add information about the price in the package title.
for example - 'discounted package price' will direct the user to open the detailed page of the package where he will also see the actual discount.
how do i mark all product variants that are out of stock, so that it is clearly visible to customers?
you can mark all products out of stock in the section my store > widgets, tab products, and product listing settings. there, there is an option to mark all products that are out of stock.
keep in mind that products need to have the quantity tracking option turned on, and if the product has variants and at least one of them is in stock, the product will not be marked as out of stock.
if you select the variants to be radio button type, every variant will be crossed out and cannot be selected. this is enough to suggest that a certain variant cannot be purchased.
you can change the variant type from the section products > variants by clicking on the variant name. how do i select only certain products to import when importing xml?
you cannot select a specific part of the file, but you have the option not to display a given product category.
besides, after importing, you can mark the products which you want as unpublished or hidden and they will not be offered. can i import products in my store via an xml file?
yes, the cloudcart platform allows xml import of products via the xml products import app. you can read more here how to import products from an xml file?
why, when importing xml the discounted product prices are not reflected? make sure that the xml file contains information about the discounted product prices.
also, check the tags you have set for the product prices in the settings of the xml import application and if you have marked them with a tick so that they are updated at every synchronization.
how can i get a check on the current stock of all products? use the google sheets app.
you can read how it works on the following page: how to make bulk changes to your catalog with the google sheets app. how does synchronization with the xml synchronization app take place?
the xml synchronization is used for synchronization from one site to another. it may be another cloudcart store or another platform, which provides an xml file for synchronization.
if you have two stores in cloudcart, you can synchronize your product catalog (including stock) via the free apps xml synchronization and cloudcart xml product feed.
this synchronization is one-sided. this means that if you have store a and you synchronize it with store b when making a sale in store a, the stock will be reduced in store b.
when there is a sale in store b, the stock in a will not be reduced. when using these two applications, you will need to take care of the stock in store a yourself.
this type of synchronization is done over a certain period of time, meaning that it does not react to events (for example, a sale or a change of a given product's status).
how does the synchronization with the cloudcart synchronizer app take place? the cloudcart synchronizer app is used to synchronize stocks in real time.
it is installed in one of the stores, and the other store or stores are set in it. an important condition is for the stores to be in one user account.
another important condition is that the products in the stores have a coinciding identifier (for example sku).
before you use this app, you need to import the products you want because this app only synchronizes; it does not import products.
if you have identical products in the two stores with identical sku identifiers, the synchronization will happen at an event for a given product, not immediately.
for example, if a product is purchased from store 1, in store 2 the quantity will be updated right away.
if you change the quantity in store 2 (can also be done manually) the change will be reflected in store 1 immediately. how do i update the feed of my fb product catalog?
to update the feed link in your facebook product catalog, you need to make sure that each of the following steps is performed correctly - see here.
why, during xml import, not all products did upload from the file? review the file for duplicated product identifiers. often this is the reason for the import of fewer products.
is there an option for a product with a stock of 0 to hide automatically? yes, there is such a setting. it is located in my store > widgets >
product listing settings: when creating a category, i do not find a suitable definition from the drop-down menu.
if you do not find a suitable category from the drop-down menu, this means that the category you want to add does not correspond to the niche of your online business, which you have set in the initial settings of your store.
in this case, you can go to the section settings > general settings and add another main niche. i can't upload more than 2500 products via an xml file. what should i do?
if you are on a business plan, you have 2500 products included that you can import. you can buy an additional package here.
with the enterprise plan, there is no limit to the number of products that can be imported. how do i generate an xml feed for a google ads ad?
with the google dynamic ads app, you can create an xml product catalog according to google's requirements. can i use more than one xml file?
you can create more than one xml task, but you need to switch off the active one to create a second one. you can have only one active task.

for a product not to be shown in your store, you need to mark it as out of stock and in the section, my store > widgets, tab products >
product listing settings, turn off the option for showing out of stock products. why does the polycomp app import fewer products?
cloudcart calculates the number of products it processes from polycomp regardless of whether they have the status ‘in stock’ / ‘out of stock’ / ‘on the way’ or any other status.
in the app’s settings, there is an option to import products with a specific status and from here you can select all products or only those that are in stock.
if you select only products that are in stock, only products with the status ‘in stock’ will be imported.
we process 50 products from the entire polycomp catalog, for example, but we choose from these 50 products only those that are marked with the status ‘in stock’, so it is likely that the imported products will be fewer than 50.
the imported products will certainly be 50 if you select all products from the option to import products.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000486289
how to localize your product catalog automatically?,"in this article, we will check out how to translate and localize your product catalog automatically.
e.g. if you have another store, copied from your original one, that is in another language, you need to translate your entire product catalog, which can sometimes be quite time consuming.
to automate this process, you must first do a few things: 1.
first, make sure that your entire product catalog, all your products are copied from your original store to your brand new language version of your business. 2.
the next thing is to go to the apps section of your admin panel, all apps > google sheets.

this will initiate a job that will upload all your products directly into a google sheet. 4. once it's ready, open that spreadsheet from the corresponding button: 5.
after you open the table you will see which columns need to be translated. this can be just one column or several.
most often these are the columns with the product name, description, or short description. to translate the desired column you need to create another additional column next to it.
in the first row of it, you have to type the following thing: open a bracket and specify the line you want to be translated, in our case it's e2 (specify it by selecting it), then put a comma, and enter the abbreviation of the source language in quotes and the target language you want to translate your catalog to it also in quotes.
then close the brackets.
it should look like this, but with your source and target language: =googletranslate(e2, ""bg"", ""en"") once you have entered this information in the first row of your newly created column, the text in this first row will be translated into the target language.
to translate all the information in the other rows below, you just need to double-click in the right corner of the first row of the new column.
this will load all the texts you need to translate into the target language, absolutely automatically. all the texts now have been successfully translated: 6.
once all the information has been translated, copy the column name of the source language and paste it into the header of the new column into the target language.
then select and copy the new column, and paste it in place of the old one using the right mouse button, > paste special > paste values only. that will paste only the values, only the texts. 7.
аfter placing the column in place of the old one, you can delete the working column. you won´t need it anymore (the f column in our case). 8.
you are free to correct the translated texts if you want to change something. once you are done, get back to the admin panel of your store and press the button download from google sheets.
it will upload all the products from google sheets and update them into your store. your entire product catalog will be automatically translated into the target language.
in the products section you can check how your translated products look like: 9. the only thing you need to do manually is the translation of the categories and the variants.
but these are just a few words, the big work is already done automatically thanks to the integration of google sheets in your cloudcart store.

usage, suggestions, and examples 1. what can customer segments be used for? through this action, you can create multiple user groups (segments) and bundle them together by common criteria.
the purpose of segmentation is to distinguish a segment of users for your marketing campaigns. by segmenting, you'll be able to market a lot of users contextually.
you can use up to 4 criteria at a time to create a single segment.
the criteria (conditions) available to you to create segments are: by order status by volume of revenue by number of orders by date of registration by date of last order whether it accepts marketing messages by country by region (city) by tag by customer group affiliation on products ordered by category date of abandoned cart by communication channel by additional fields to the profile each segment you create is automatically updated with users who fall within its terms.
important: each segment also has a unique url address, where the data of users participating in it, is accessible.
never share this address publicly because it contains your clients' names and email addresses.
these lists are for your own personal use or the use of third-party applications to draw this information in your favour. 2. examples if a segment of users placed an order exactly 2 days ago.
your message will be much more concrete. you can start your communication using known parameters such as ""time"".
the start of your message can look like this: two days ago you placed your order in our store... when you define your segment criteria, you will be able to use it for different purposes.
for example, you will be able to send messages via messenger or viber directly from the admin panel of your store.
you will be able to use the marketing results through external applications and more. 3.
suggestions here are some ideas you might find helpful when creating user segments: segmentation for customers who purchased merchandise more than 60 days ago and spent an amount greater than eur 100.
with this segment, you will be able to reactivate customers who have purchased a while ago.
category x and y shopping - with this segment, you'll be able to create customized cross-sell targeting the specific client group.
messenger subscribers who have placed more than 0 orders worth more than eur 0 - this will allow you to screen out your important customers and write directly to messenger with a specific proposal.
creating customer segments 1. from your admin panel go to customers > segments 2. click on add segment and choose the name and type of the desired segment 3. after you add a segment, enter its name. 4. once you've entered a name and selected the segment type, it's time to save it.

how to install the cloudcart gdpr application?,"in this section: how to install and configure the cloudcart gdpr application settings section policies section data processing register section faq
cloudcart infrastructure is compliant with all gdpr regulatory requirements so that it can safely record, manage, and transmit data in secure (encrypted) environments.
cloudcart has a pci dss level 1 security certificate that verifies the level of security for data transfer and storage.
аdditionally, оur team has developed cloudcart gdpr for online stores which aims to automatically implement much of the gdpr requirements.
block cookies with 'prior consent' cloudcart gdpr enables you to block cookies from being placed on a visitor's computer until you have received explicit consent. what is prior consent?
the gdpr and the european eprivacy directive require getting explicit consent before using cookies other than those necessary for the website to work properly.
that means when a visitor comes to your website, you have to hold all your cookies until they agree to get them. you’ll show them the cookie banner and if they are opt-in, you send the cookies.
if they remain passive or if they don’t agree, you have to keep blocking the cookies from getting into their computers.
there are many websites with cookie banners, but without prior consent installed. they are not eprivacy and gdpr compliant, and thus risk fines.
these banners will send tracking cookies as soon as the visitor lands on the website.
they ask for consent, but since there is no blocking mechanism in place, they insert cookies even when visitors are passive or decline the consent request. law-wise, these banners serve no purpose.
prior consent tools allow you to block all the cookies other than those that must be injected straight into your visitor’s computer until they agree on that.
with cloudcart gdpr, you can easily set it up and manage it through the admin dashboard. do i need prior consent?
yes, if you track your users’ personal data by using tracking technologies, then you need to ask for prior consent. hence, you need a tool for blocking the cookies before getting consent.
we have prepared a list of steps that you need to do to ensure that your company meets all gdpr requirements.

the cloudcart platform does not allow for the creation of such a button upon order completion because it is in violation of the general regulation of gdpr.",https://help.cloudcart.com/en/support/solutions/articles/77000166283
"product images, banners and sliders","cloudcart allows you to have customized product images as well as banners and sliders of your choosing. product images 1.
the product images are added from products > go into the product in question > image manager the suggested size of all product images is 1280 x 1280 pixels, which is the optimal size.
additionally, cloudcart optimizes and compresses each uploaded product image for better results and the best possible loading speed for your site. 2.
additionally, cloudcart resizes the images in a few formats, so they can be used in all ""websafe"" visualizations. 3.
all images added to your online store are protected, by the so-called ""digital watermark"".
the watermark protects your store through a digital passport, which contains information about the creator of the site, the merchant, and title+description of the product itself. 4.
the photo compressor that cloudcart uses is fundamentally the same as the image compressor used by tinypng banner images the different-sized banners in your store would be determined by priority and positioning on the page.
they need to be added with high-resolution and decent-optimization 1. by default, the banners in your store and managed from: my store > widgets > others > banners 1&2 2.

creating sliders the sliders on your store allow for displaying multiple images, which can be linked with a product or another part of your online store.
they are incredibly useful, as they fulfill both the functions of advertisement and a hotlink to your products. you have the option to animate sliders using a fade or slide effect.
we advise you to add sliders with no more than 1900 pixels of width. regarding the high - it needs to be the same so all images can be visualized the same.
you choose the appropriate height for your home page. please use the images with the best quality and compress them, before adding them to your control panel.
this way you would ""lighten up"" your home page and therefore speed up its loading time. 1. the sliders, much like the banners, can be customized through the widgets: my store > widgets > others >
slider 2. again, though the landing page, you can add a slider where you like on your store: marketing > landing pages > add a new page > drag & drop page builder > add new widget >

high level of security for your online store,"
ecommerce is a blooming business globally, which draws more and more players to the market, but along with this internet attacks from malicious users in the form of bots, denial of service attack, eavesdropping, sql injection and many others are growing.
in this article, you will understand how the cloudcart platform provides you with the necessary protection against all these threats and ensures a high level of security both during the checkout process and when using the store as a whole.
you will learn which are the features that help you as a merchant to filter fake orders, threats, attacks from different sides and to keep your business in good shape.
in this section: system for monitoring and analysis of usage.
the kubernetes platform system for monitoring your website - a trap for ""bad"" bots tokenized system security of the checkout process orders - fraud protection section security - block clients ip addresses system for monitoring and analysis of usage.
the kubernetes platform this is an example website that we can take a look at: under the hood, however, we have something very special.
we have several systems that manage the processes related to your users or the bots which crawl your site. based on these tools, we can mimic and handle some of the attackers, probably most.
you would hardly notice any changes when you browse the website as a regular user. in the background, however, we have a complicated process for monitoring and analysing usage.
we have a complex system that monitors the usage of the platform. we can block, delay or slow down some users based on certain signals we identify. this brings benefits to you as a merchant.
imagine that you are a very popular brand that works online. maybe you want to enjoy great popularity - you invest money in advertising and brand awareness.
in this case, the likelihood of attracting hackers' attention is considerable.
if someone wants to do you wrong, i.e. crash your site, he will have to investigate your platform and your weakest points.
but in cloudcart, the risk of this happening is minimized because the cloudcart infrastructure is built on kubernetes - a google platform.
based on this technology, we have different servers at different times, and all these servers are constantly changing, so your site's files are not located on a specific server.
they are distributed among different servers. system for monitoring your website - a trap for ""bad"" bots we have a system to monitor the use of your website.
this means that if someone, for example, browses your website in less than a second and makes several requests per second, it is not a person.
we can slow down these users, probably bots, from crawling your website quickly.
of course, there are conventions in the world for creating bots and crawlers, and most of the good players, white bots like google, bing, yahoo, etc., bring their functionality in line with these conventions.
however, this is not about good bots or crawlers but bad ones. of course, we are constantly building a list of ""bad"" crawlers, we have bot traps across the platform to identify and ban them.
most popular ""bad"" bots are blocked for cloudcart users, but if someone builds such a brand new bot, we need to be prepared.
this is the place of this system to identify the use of the platform, user behavior.
based on artificial intelligence technology, we investigate and obtain this particular user (bot) and ban it because it threatens us.
tokenized system imagine you have a home key and can share it with your friends. however, this key only opens specific rooms in your home, not the entire home.
if you take the key from one of your friends, that friend will be blocked, he will no longer have access. this is how our stores work. we give our customers the keys to your ""home"" - your store.
but if someone is somehow identified as a bot, we will take that key out of your ""home"" and lock it. this technology gives us the ability to stop unwanted traffic to your website.
nowadays, bad traffic is three times more than good traffic.
with the three security systems described above you have an extremely stable ecosystem that is constantly monitoring your website for malicious users and blocks them from the entire platform in a timely manner.
security of the checkout process the checkout process is one of the most advanced technologies in cloudcart.
here is an example of what completing an order looks like: a priority for the online platform is for the order completion process to be as simple as possible.
still, at the same time, the goal of the checkout process is to give all the necessary information for an order: products, discounts, payment, shipping, customer, and customer address.
different marketing tools such as bumpcart, cros-sell and upsell and countdown discounts increase the possibilities of checkout.
the goal is to persuade your users that they have limited time and must take action immediately.
this makes your business successful and increases the average order value and the most important metric - the conversion rate.
the cloudcart checkout gives you an almost 2.5 times higher conversion rate than the standard one.
the checkout process is the holy grail of online trading, and if the cloudcart platform has any weak points that allow malicious users access, 90% of your orders will be fake.
if today you have 100 real orders, but the orders are 1000, how much will you have to invest in human capital to filter the real ones?
the cloudcart checkout process meets high-security standards and protects you against this problem.
above all, the cloudcart checkout process is not accessible for bots, even google does not have the right to access here. what happens if someone mimics software like a real person?
currently, technology in this regard is still poorly developed, and the only thing that can be done is to find out exactly who this person is.
and if a person tries to harm you by making fake orders, you have several types of protection in the administrative panel of your store.
orders - fraud protection section go to your admin panel, orders section > orders and open a random order. each order in cloudcart has a fraud protection section in the lower right corner.
this section shows you the real ip address of the user. the ip address is checked on the basis of several points and it is judged whether it is safe to shop from it or not.
if it is safe, it will be green, as in this case. if not, you will be notified here to be aware that there is a problem.
pay attention to the fraud protection section, because your cloudcart store is equipped with a fraud protection engine that monitors absolutely every order.
security - block clients ip addresses blocking these days does not mean blocking an entire page, because if someone finds out that an ip address is already blocked, that person can look for another ip address, and so on.
and this process will never stop.
that is why the option was created that when you block a user he can browse your website and even make purchases, but you will not accept their purchases - they will be canceled.
the user, of course, will see that the purchase is accepted, but at the same time cloudcart will deactivate or cancel this order. you can find this feature in settings > general settings >
security and select 'block clients ip addresses'. here you can add as many ip addresses as you want and they will be blocked automatically.
all orders placed from these ip addresses will be marked as canceled orders, but users who place these orders will not notice this. they will think they are flooding your website.
automatic cancelation of orders only applies to offline payment methods - cash on delivery and bank wire transfer.
